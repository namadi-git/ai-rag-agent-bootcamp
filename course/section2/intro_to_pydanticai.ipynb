Evaluate responses based on custom criteria, which helps evaluate new outputs when there\\'s no reference available.\\n\\nWe will focus on demonstrating **how to create and tune the LLM evaluator**, which you can then apply in different contexts, like regression testing or prompt comparison.\\n\\n<Info>\\n**Prefer videos?** We also have an extended code tutorial where we iteratively improve the prompt for LLM judge with a video walkthrough:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP_aaFnXLmY\\n</Info>\\n\\n## Tutorial scope\\n\\nHere\\'s what we\\'ll do:\\n\\n- **Create an evaluation dataset**. Create a toy Q&A dataset.\\n- **Create and run an LLM as a judge**. Design an LLM evaluator prompt.\\n- **Evaluate the judge**. Compare the LLM judge\\'s evaluations with manual labels.\\n\\nWe\\'ll start with the reference-based evaluator that determines whether a new response is correct (it\\'s more complex since it requires passing two columns to the prompt).

Correctness evaluator\\n\\nNow it\\'s time to set up an LLM judge! We\\'ll start with an evaluator that checks if responses are correct compared to the reference. The goal is to match the quality of our manual labels.\\n\\n**Configure the evaluator prompt**. We\\'ll use the LLMEval [Descriptor](/docs/library/descriptors) to create a custom binary evaluator. Here\\'s how to define the prompt template for correctness:\\n\\n```python\\ncorrectness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n        criteria = \"\"\"An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.\\n        The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.\\n        REFERENCE:\\n        =====\\n        {target_response}\\n        =====\"\"\",\\n        target_category=\"incorrect\",\\n        non_target_category=\"correct\",\\n        uncertainty=\"unknown\",\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\n        pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\")],\\n        )\\n```\\n\\n<Info>\\n  The **Binary Classification** template (check [docs](/metrics/customize_llm_judge)) instructs an LLM to classify the input into two classes and add reasoning. You don\\'t need to ask for these details explicitly, or worry about parsing the output structure — that\\'s built into the template. You only need to add the criteria. You can also use a multi-class template.\\n</Info>\\n\\nIn this example, we\\'ve set up the prompt to be strict (\"all fact and details\"). You can write it differently. This flexibility is one of the key benefits of creating a custom judge.\\n\\n**Score your data**. To add this new descriptor to your dataset, run:\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n    LLMEval(\"new_response\",\\n            template=correctness,\\n            provider = \"openai\",\\n            model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            alias=\"Correctness\",\\n            additional_columns={\"target_response\": \"target_response\"}),\\n    ])\\n```\\n\\n**Preview the results**. You can view the scored dataset in Python. This will show a DataFrame with newly added scores and explanations.\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\n```\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_judge_scored_data-min.png)\\n\\n<Info>\\n  **Note**: your explanations will vary since LLMs are non-deterministic.\\n</Info>\\n\\nIf you want, you can also add the column that will help you easily sort and find all error where the LLM-judged label is different from the ground truth label.\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n    ExactMatch(columns=[\"label\", \"Correctness\"], alias=\"Judge_match\")])\\n```\\n\\n**Get a Report.** Summarize the result by generating an Evidently Report.\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n```\\n\\nThis will render an HTML report in the notebook cell. You can use other [export options](/docs/library/output_formats), like `as_dict()` for a Python dictionary output.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_report-min.png)\\n\\nSince we already performed exact matching, you can see the crude accuracy of our judge. However, accuracy is not always the best metric. In this case, we might be more interested in recall: we want to make sure that the judge does not miss any \"incorrect\" answers .\\n\\n## 4. Evaluate the LLM Eval quality\\n\\nThis part is a bit meta: we\\'re going to evaluate the quality of our LLM evaluator itself\\\\! We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\n\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first.

       " ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='To run an LLM (Language Model) as a judge for evaluations, you can follow a structured approach using the Evidently library in Python. This process leverages LLMs to assess responses against defined criteria or references. Here’s a step-by-step guide based on the tutorial from the Evidently documentation:\\n\\n### Step 1: Setup\\n\\n1. **Install Evidently**:\\n   ```bash\\n   pip install evidently\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Import Required Modules**:\\n   ```python\\n   import pandas as pd\\n   import numpy as np\\n   from evidently import Dataset, DataDefinition, Report, BinaryClassification\\n   from evidently.llm.templates import BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Set Up Your OpenAI API Key**:\\n   ```python\\n   import os\\n   os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"YOUR_KEY\"\\n   ```\\n\\n### Step 2: Create an Evaluation Dataset\\n\\nCreate a toy Q&A dataset with questions, target responses, new responses, and their labels.\\n\\n```python\\ndata = [\\n    [\"Question?\", \"Target response.\", \"New response.\", \"label\", \"comment\"],\\n    # Add more data as needed\\n]\\n\\ncolumns = [\"question\", \"target_response\", \"new_response\", \"label\", \"comment\"]\\ngolden_dataset = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)\\n\\n# Create an Evidently dataset object\\ndefinition = DataDefinition(\\n    text_columns=[\"question\", \"target_response\", \"new_response\"],\\n    categorical_columns=[\"label\"]\\n)\\n\\neval_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(golden_dataset, data_definition=definition)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Configure the LLM as a Judge\\n\\n1. **Define the Prompt Template**:\\n   For a correctness evaluator:\\n   ```python\\n   correctness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n       criteria=\"\"\"\\n       An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.\\n       The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.\\n       REFERENCE:\\n       =====\\n       {target_response}\\n       =====\"\"\",\\n       target_category=\"incorrect\",\\n       non_target_category=\"correct\",\\n       include_reasoning=True,\\n       pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert evaluator.\")],\\n   )\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Run the Evaluation**:\\n   Add the descriptor for the new responses:\\n   ```python\\n   eval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n       LLMEval(\"new_response\",\\n               template=correctness,\\n               provider=\"openai\",\\n               model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",  # Specify your LLM model\\n               alias=\"Correctness\",\\n               additional_columns={\"target_response\": \"target_response\"})\\n   ])\\n   ```\\n\\n### Step 4: Generate Reports\\n\\nGenerate a summary report of the evaluations:\\n```python\\nreport = Report([TextEvals()])\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval  # This will render an HTML report in a notebook cell or return data depending on your setup.\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Evaluate the LLM\\'s Quality\\n\\nYou can also assess the performance of the LLM judge itself through classification metrics:\\n```python\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(target=\"label\", prediction_labels=\"Correctness\")],\\n    categorical_columns=[\"label\", \"Correctness\"]\\n)\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame(eval_dataset.as_dataframe()), data_definition=definition_2)\\n\\nreport = Report([ClassificationPreset()])\\nmy_eval_quality = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval_quality\\n```\\n\\n### Extra: Verbosity Evaluator\\n\\nIf you want to set up a simpler judge that checks for verbosity:\\n```python\\nverbosity = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n    criteria=\"\"\"\\n    A concise response should:\\n    - Provide necessary information without unnecessary details or repetition.\\n    - Be brief yet comprehensive enough to address the query.\\n    \"\"\",\\n    target_category=\"concise\",\\n    non_target_category=\"verbose\",\\n    include_reasoning=True,\\n    pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert text evaluator.\")]\\n)\\n\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n    LLMEval(\"new_response\", template=verbosity, provider=\"openai\", model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", alias=\"Verbosity\")\\n])\\n```\\n\\n**Additional Resources**: For further details and a complete walkthrough, you can refer to the [Evidently LLM Judge Tutorial](https://github.com/evidentlyai/community-examples/blob/main/tutorials/LLM_as_a_judge_tutorial_updated.ipynb).\\n\\nThis structure provides a comprehensive way to utilize LLMs effectively as judges in evaluations.')], usage=RequestUsage(input_tokens=7892, cache_read_tokens=3072, output_tokens=957, details={'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}), model_name='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2025, 10, 27, 1, 56, 52, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)), provider_name='openai', provider_details={'finish_reason': 'stop'}, provider_response_id='chatcmpl-CV6lYd99GnmeWrDIvwyXRhpSr2dV1', finish_reason='stop')]"

The approved responses you consider accurate.\\n- **New responses**. Imitated new responses from the system.\\n- **Manual labels with explanation**. Labels that say if response is correct or not.\\n\\nWhy add the labels? It\\'s a good idea to be the judge yourself before you write a prompt. This helps:\\n\\n- Formulate better criteria. You discover nuances that help you write a better prompt.\\n- Get the \"ground truth\".

Correctness evaluator\\n\\nNow it\\'s time to set up an LLM judge! We\\'ll start with an evaluator that checks if responses are correct compared to the reference. The goal is to match the quality of our manual labels.\\n\\n**Configure the evaluator prompt**. We\\'ll use the LLMEval [Descriptor](/docs/library/descriptors) to create a custom binary evaluator. Here\\'s how to define the prompt template for correctness:\\n\\n```python\\ncorrectness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n        criteria = \"\"\"An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.\\n        The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.\\n        REFERENCE:\\n        =====\\n        {target_response}\\n        =====\"\"\",\\n        target_category=\"incorrect\",\\n        non_target_category=\"correct\",\\n        uncertainty=\"unknown\",\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\n        pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\")],\\n        )\\n```\\n\\n<Info>\\n  The **Binary Classification** template (check [docs](/metrics/customize_llm_judge)) instructs an LLM to classify the input into two classes and add reasoning. You don\\'t need to ask for these details explicitly, or worry about parsing the output structure — that\\'s built into the template. You only need to add the criteria. You can also use a multi-class template.\\n</Info>\\n\\nIn this example, we\\'ve set up the prompt to be strict (\"all fact and details\"). You can write it differently. This flexibility is one of the key benefits of creating a custom judge.\\n\\n**Score your data**. To add this new descriptor to your dataset, run:\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n    LLMEval(\"new_response\",\\n            template=correctness,\\n            provider = \"openai\",\\n            model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            alias=\"Correctness\",\\n            additional_columns={\"target_response\": \"target_response\"}),\\n    ])\\n```\\n\\n**Preview the results**. You can view the scored dataset in Python. This will show a DataFrame with newly added scores and explanations.\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\n```\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_judge_scored_data-min.png)\\n\\n<Info>\\n  **Note**: your explanations will vary since LLMs are non-deterministic.\\n</Info>\\n\\nIf you want, you can also add the column that will help you easily sort and find all error where the LLM-judged label is different from the ground truth label.\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n    ExactMatch(columns=[\"label\", \"Correctness\"], alias=\"Judge_match\")])\\n```\\n\\n**Get a Report.** Summarize the result by generating an Evidently Report.\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n```\\n\\nThis will render an HTML report in the notebook cell. You can use other [export options](/docs/library/output_formats), like `as_dict()` for a Python dictionary output.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_report-min.png)\\n\\nSince we already performed exact matching, you can see the crude accuracy of our judge. However, accuracy is not always the best metric. In this case, we might be more interested in recall: we want to make sure that the judge does not miss any \"incorrect\" answers .\\n\\n## 4. Evaluate the LLM Eval quality\\n\\nThis part is a bit meta: we\\'re going to evaluate the quality of our LLM evaluator itself\\\\! We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\n\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first. The column with the manual label is the \"target\", and the LLM-judge response is the \"prediction\":\\n\\n```python\\ndf=eval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\n\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(\\n        target=\"label\",\\n        prediction_labels=\"Correctness\",\\n        pos_label = \"incorrect\")],\\n    categorical_columns=[\"label\", \"Correctness\"])\\n\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\n    data_definition=definition_2)\\n```\\n\\n<Info>\\n  `Pos_label` refers to the class that is treated as the target (\"what we want to predict better\") for metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.\\n</Info>\\n\\n**Get a Report**. Let\\'s use a`ClassificationPreset()` that combines several classification metrics:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n\\n# or my_eval.as_dict()\\n```\\n\\nWe can now get a well-rounded evaluation and explore the confusion matrix. We have one type of error each: overall the results are pretty good\\\\! You can also refine the prompt to try to improve them.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_conf_matrix-min.png)\\n\\n## 5. Verbosity evaluator\\n\\nNext, let’s create a simpler verbosity judge. It will check whether the responses are concise and to the point. This only requires evaluating one output column: such checks are perfect for production evaluations where you don’t have a reference answer.\\n\\nHere\\'s how to set up the prompt template for verbosity:\\n\\n```python\\nverbosity = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n        criteria = \"\"\"Conciseness refers to the quality of being brief and to the point, while still providing all necessary information.\\n            A concise response should:\\n            - Provide the necessary information without unnecessary details or repetition.\\n            - Be brief yet comprehensive enough to address the query.\\n            - Use simple and direct language to convey the message effectively.\"\"\",\\n        target_category=\"concise\",\\n        non_target_category=\"verbose\",\\n        uncertainty=\"unknown\",\\n        include_reasoning=True,\\n        pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert text evaluator. You will be given a text of the response to a user question.\")],\\n        )\\n```\\n\\nAdd this new descriptor to our existing dataset:\\n\\n```python\\neval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n    LLMEval(\"new_response\",\\n            template=verbosity,\\n            provider = \"openai\",\\n            model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            alias=\"Verbosity\")\\n    ])\\n```\\n\\nRun the Report and view the summary results:\\xa0\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n```\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_verbosity-min.png)\\n\\nYou can also view the dataframe using `eval_dataset.as_dataframe()`\\n\\n<Info>\\n  Don\\'t fully agree with the results? Use these labels as a starting point, edit the decisions where you see fit - now you\\'ve got your golden dataset\\\\! Next, iterate on your judge prompt. You can also try different evaluator LLMs to see which one does the job better. [How to change an LLM](/metrics/customize_llm_judge#change-the-evaluator-llm).\\n</Info>\\n\\n## What\\'s next?\\n\\nThe LLM judge itself is just one part of your overall evaluation framework.

Create the Dataset\\n\\nFirst, we\\'ll create a toy Q&A dataset with customer support question that includes:\\n\\n- **Questions**. The inputs sent to the LLM app.\\n- **Target responses**. The approved responses you consider accurate.\\n- **New responses**. Imitated new responses from the system.\\n- **Manual labels with explanation**. Labels that say if response is correct or not.\\n\\nWhy add the labels? It\\'s a good idea to be the judge yourself before you write a prompt. This helps:\\n\\n- Formulate better criteria. You discover nuances that help you write a better prompt.\\n- Get the \"ground truth\". You can use it to evaluate the quality of the LLM judge.\\n\\nUltimately, an LLM judge is a small ML system, and it needs its own evals\\\\!\\n\\n**Generate the dataframe**. Here\\'s how you can create this dataset in one go:\\n\\n<Accordion title=\"Toy data to run the example\" defaultOpen={false}>\\n  ```python\\n  ', 'title': 'LLM as a judge', 'description': 'How to create and evaluate an LLM judge.', 'filename': 'examples/LLM_judge.mdx'}, {'start': 20000, 'content': 'openai\",\\n            model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            alias=\"Verbosity\")\\n    ])\\n```\\n\\nRun the Report and view the summary results:\\xa0\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n```\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_verbosity-min.png)\\n\\nYou can also view the dataframe using `eval_dataset.as_dataframe()`\\n\\n<Info>\\n  Don\\'t fully agree with the results? Use these labels as a starting point, edit the decisions where you see fit - now you\\'ve got your golden dataset\\\\! Next, iterate on your judge prompt. You can also try different evaluator LLMs to see which one does the job better. [How to change an LLM](/metrics/customize_llm_judge#change-the-evaluator-llm).\\n</Info>\\n\\n## What\\'s next?\\n\\nThe LLM judge itself is just one part of your overall evaluation framework. You can integrate this evaluator into different workflows, such as testing your LLM outputs after changing a prompt.\\n\\nTo be able to easily run and compare evals, systematically track the results, and interact with your evaluation dataset, you can use the Evidently Cloud platform.\\n\\n### Set up Evidently Cloud\\n\\n<CloudSignup />\\n\\nImport the components to connect with Evidently Cloud:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom evidently.ui.workspace import CloudWorkspace\\n```\\n\\n### Create a Project\\n\\n<CreateProject />\\n\\n### Send your eval\\n\\nSince you already created the eval, you can simply upload it to the Evidently Cloud.\\n\\n```python\\nws.add_run(project.id, my_eval, include_data=True)\\n```\\n\\nYou can then go to the Evidently Cloud, open your Project and explore the Report.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_cloud-min.png)\\n\\n<Info>\\n  You can also [create the LLM judges with no-code](/docs/platform/evals_no_code).\\n</Info>\\n\\n# Reference documentation\\n\\nSee this page for complete [documentation on LLM judges](/metrics/customize_llm_judge).', 'title': 'LLM as a judge', 'description': 'How to create and evaluate an LLM judge.', 'filename': 'examples/LLM_judge.mdx'}, {'start': 17000, 'content': '\\nSince we already performed exact matching, you can see the crude accuracy of our judge. However, accuracy is not always the best metric. In this case, we might be more interested in recall: we want to make sure that the judge does not miss any \"incorrect\" answers .\\n\\n## 4. Evaluate the LLM Eval quality\\n\\nThis part is a bit meta: we\\'re going to evaluate the quality of our LLM evaluator itself\\\\! We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\n\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first. The column with the manual label is the \"target\", and the LLM-judge response is the \"prediction\":\\n\\n```python\\ndf=eval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\n\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(\\n        target=\"label\",\\n        prediction_labels=\"Correctness\",\\n        pos_label = \"incorrect\")],\\n    categorical_columns=[\"label\", \"Correctness\"])\\n\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\n    data_definition=definition_2)\\n```\\n\\n<Info>\\n  `Pos_label` refers to the class that is treated as the target (\"what we want to predict better\") for metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.\\n</Info>\\n\\n**Get a Report**. Let\\'s use a`ClassificationPreset()` that combines several classification metrics:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n\\n# or my_eval.as_dict()\\n```\\n\\nWe can now get a well-rounded evaluation and explore the confusion matrix. We have one type of error each: overall the results are pretty good\\\\! You can also refine the prompt to try to improve them.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_conf_matrix-min.png)\\n\\n## 5. Verbosity evaluator\\n\\nNext, let’s create a simpler verbosity judge. It will check whether the responses are concise and to the point. This only requires evaluating one output column: such checks are perfect for production evaluations where you don’t have a reference answer.\\n\\nHere\\'s ho', 'title': 'LLM as a judge', 'description': 'How to create and evaluate an LLM judge.', 'filename': 'examples/LLM_judge.mdx'}]</pre>\n",
