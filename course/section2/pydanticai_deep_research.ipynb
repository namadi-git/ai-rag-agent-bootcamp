Niche is uh\\n24:10 developer stack developer tooling and a\\n24:12 lot of this is open source because open\\n24:14 source is a great go to market model for\\n24:17 those kind of companies but not\\n24:18 everything we do is open source but not\\n24:20 every everything we do is even developer\\n24:24 tooling but the most of it so\\n24:27 um yeah as you said we're doing pre-seed\\n24:29 seed seed runs mainly in Europe\\n24:32 so we would also do but mainly in Europe\\n24:35 um and so yeah we we really like as I\\n24:39 said in this Niche\\n24:41 um Founders and companies for the strong\\n24:43 focus on Community Driven go-to markets\\n24:46 as for example open source\\n24:49 um and this includes like we did stuff\\n24:53 in AI infrastructure in cyber security\\n24:55 and cloud in data streaming so\\n24:58 um but we also did uh to mention here\\n25:01 maybe not not interesting for everyone\\n25:02 watching this but we also did\\n25:04 investments in in other areas of B2B\\n25:07 software like inter Logistics data\\n25:09 privacy Robotics and and so on and so\\n25:12 forth so but the main focus I would say\\n25:14 80 of what we do nowadays is in this\\n25:17 niche\\n25:18 we already talked about angels so they\\n25:21 are individuals who have some money and\\n25:24 they invest maybe not so much money but\\n25:27 they have some money and they say okay\\n25:28 these startups promising here's\\n25:31 a small\\n25:32 investment\\n25:34 and there are also VC funds these are\\n25:37 larger organizations with more money so\\n25:39 they\\n25:40 I guess typically invest they give more\\n25:43 money to companies and there are also\\n25:\", 'video_id': '7Bg1JQLnCao'}, {'start': 10500, 'content': \"8 from the beginning right if you're\\n11:00 thinking about bootstrapping something\\n11:03 um which can be definitely a great way\\n11:05 because also\\n11:06 um I I have to say not every startup not\\n11:09 every Tech business even is a venture\\n11:12 case\\n11:13 um but\\n11:15 um it definitely is something that you\\n11:17 that you can have a salary that you can\\n11:19 make a living from your startup from day\\n11:22 one\\n11:23 um yeah at least from day one when you\\n11:25 raised\\n11:27 um so yeah that's that's why I would say\\n11:29 they're needed so investors give\\n11:32 Founders money to run a company to build\\n11:35 the startup and the alternative you\\n11:37 mentioned is bootstrapping when the\\n11:40 founders do not\\n11:42 look for external investment in external\\n11:45 money they try to earn money themselves\\n11:47 and then from this money so they focus\\n11:49 on profitability and then from this\\n11:51 money the way\\n11:53 themselves the salary and then hire the\\n11:55 first employees but it's not always easy\\n11:57 and I guess especially in open source\\n11:59 right so open source is usually\\n12:01 if you do not directly from day one make\\n12:04 money out of Open Source yeah it's and\\n12:07 it's slower and it it's also defocuses\\n12:10 you from from growing and building\\n12:13 um because you always have to think\\n12:14 about oh how can I um I don't know\\n12:17 Finance the next month\\n12:19 um and so on but\\n12:21 um yeah that that are the two main main\\n12:23 ways I I mean there are some people who\\n12:25 already made some money who can who can\\n12:27 Finance their own Venture but then\\n12:29 they're their own investors I would say\\n12:31 so this also goes in the category of of\\n12:34 having an investor\\n12:36 which means let's say I work at the\\n12:39 usual full-time job I set aside some\\n12:41 money\\n12:42 and then with this money I can just run\\n12:44 a company then I don't need an investor\\n12:47 yeah you have a you have something for\\n12:49 the start but it really depends on what\\n12:52 kind of business you want to build it\\n12:53 really differs um if you have a\\n12:55 bootstrap business building uh like in\\n12:57 profitability from day one maybe a\\n13:00 little bit slower but\\n13:02 um you definitely know what to do their\\n13:06 Adventure is is also you really have to\\n13:09 know that it it is a little bit\\n13:10 different if you take money the first\\n13:12 time from an investor you definitely\\n13:14 need to have it a second and a third\\n13:16 time so it's\\n13:19 um you have to decide for which way you\\n13:20 want to go but especially in in the\\n13:23 um yeah in the ecosystem right now and\\n13:25 in data and open source I would say\\n13:27 there are so many\\n13:29 um yeah you really have to see\\n13:31 um where you find your spot in terms of\\n13:33 competition and positioning and it's\\n13:35 hard to compete\\n13:37 um without having having any money in\\n13:39 your pockets\\n13:41 just uh it's not one of the questions we\\n13:44 plan to ask you but maybe you have some\\n13:46 ideas why do companies actually\\n13:49 do busin\", 'video_id': '7Bg1JQLnCao'},

these\\n5:32 days I assume because we have ch GPT and\\n5:36 it became so popular that everyone knows\\n5:39 now that AI is a\\n5:41 thing right I think it's from side it\\n5:45 got very accessible so before to be an\\n5:49 AI expert you at least need to know how\\n5:52 to code so there's at least some kind of\\n5:54 a mode now you need to be able to talk\\n5:58 or to to spell and then you can become a\\n6:02 prompt engineer and prompt engineer is\\n6:06 already for many people halfway the AI\\n6:08 expert don't necessarily have to spell\\n6:11 words correctly because AI will no no\\n6:14 I'm not saying gtic I I just like that\\n6:17 you somehow use a keyboard yeah and then\\n6:20 you prompt something then you create a\\n6:22 prompt library and voila you can call\\n6:26 yourself a fot leader and AI expert but\\n6:31 of course that's uh going to be not for\\n6:34 a long time like this there a lot of\\n6:36 people will um filter out the demand for\\n6:40 these drops but currently yes and the\\n6:44 other point is of course currently a lot\\n6:46 of people lots of Industry want to do\\n6:49 something with AI it's almost like a the\\n6:53 sign that you're an Innovative mod\\n6:55 company if you necessarily build an AI\\n6:59 product and it doesn't matter if AI is\\n7:01 actually applicable there but as I read\\n7:05 in one of the Articles if the only thing\\n7:07 that you have is a generative AI Hammer\\n7:10 everything looks like an generative AI\\n7:12 nail so everyone's trying to build\\n7:15 something to show to others to investors\\n7:18 to management that they have this and\\n7:20 therefore there is a demand for AI\\n7:22 experts and the more of them growing\\n7:25 like mushrooms nowadays MH around yeah I\\n7:29 just came back from a forest and because\\n7:33 the weather is uh it's very humid like\\n7:36 there's uh it's like it's not raining\\n7:39 all the time but like when you go to the\\n7:41 forest there are so many mushrooms so\\n7:44 I'm a very uh enthusiastic mushroom\\n7:48 picker I have around 10 kilograms of\\n7:51 Frozen\\n7:53 mushrooms in my fridge\\n7:56 so yeah yes this year was very good like\\n7:59 not for AI experts but also for\\n8:01 mushrooms yeah right exactly this is\\n8:03 what I wanted to say uh and yeah because\\n8:06 of this hype but uh maybe it's also a\\n8:08 good thing CU like some people who do\\n8:10 not necessarily have the programming\\n8:11 background now can\\n8:14 be how to say can make impact so we will\\n8:17 see of course in a couple of years if\\n8:19 this will still be in demand but while\\n8:21 there is demand um perhaps it's not such\\n8:24 a bad thing right I I think that's a\\n8:25 normal evolution of any area that gets\\n8:30 people who are successful will stay no\\n8:32

a much easier um\\n44:55 discussion I mean so for your latest\\n44:57 round it was you were already profitable\\n45:00 so it was easier to convince investors\\n45:02 that they should give you money honestly\\n45:04 we had to because after all the crisis\\n45:07 we had in the world right um the\\n45:09 investors also changed so the investors\\n45:12 don't it was not enough for them to just\\n45:15 see good visions and good papers and\\n45:17 good slides they also want to see that\\n45:19 you are able to run a business that you\\n45:21 can earn money over the last months and\\n45:24 years that became very important for\\n45:25 them so I think in nowadays that's one\\n45:28 of the main things you have to do as\\n45:30 like company or founder um to really\\n45:33 prove okay we have the possibility to\\n45:35 make money not just a good idea and we\\n45:38 don't need 100 million to get the first\\n45:40 money we also like have good business\\n45:43 cases already\\n45:45 here but

right but it's an\\n45:57 operational problem you can definitely\\n46:00 solve how do you earn money now is it by\\n46:04 affiliation with something or like\\n46:06 people need to pay recommendation so we\\n46:09 integrate our AI to different partners\\n46:12 right so we do the health checks on\\n46:14 different point of yeah sales so first\\n46:17 of all of course in our own application\\n46:18 skin where is the digital clinic but we\\n46:21 also have other applications um and\\n46:24 other Point of Sales where people are\\n46:25 using our technology so it's more like a\\n46:29 yeah I would say software as a service\\n46:30 model um and this is definitely where\\n46:33 you have better use cases in\\n46:36 right so if I detect some skin problems\\n46:39 and then the app recommends me like a\\n46:41 specific treatment specific cream or\\n46:45 like something and buy it throughout the\\n46:47 app then you get a cut right yeah also\\n46:50 yeah okay and right now you have enough\\n46:54 money to like\\n46:56 yeah sorry no I was just want to say but\\n46:59 of course in health it's more regulated\\n47:00 so you have to make a difference between\\n47:02 like lifestyle product like skin care\\n47:05 and skin Health but I mean that's for\\n47:08 for now pretty much too much the only\\n47:10 thing I just want to let the people know\\n47:12 is that um of course it depends on the\\n47:15 market the regulation and the software\\n47:17 you created right but make sure that you\\n47:20 can show that your technology has the\\n47:22 potential to earn\\n47:24 money this is what my

going to survive as a separated all for\\n22:15 long I think it's going to be data\\n22:17 engineering\\n22:19 again um so yeah uh so there is one of\\n22:22 the use cases obviously but I think the\\n22:25 most interesting things that you can do\\n22:27 with AI is when you don't don't even see\\n22:29 that this is AI like some report that\\n22:32 tells you some data based on text for\\n22:34 example I was doing a project when we\\n22:36 analyzing the reviews from uh from\\n22:41 Google and uh the goal was to find out\\n22:45 what works at a particular location of\\n22:48 the company source and what what doesn't\\n22:52 and create a report on this and it was\\n22:54 not screening to the user this is made\\n22:56 with AI but but was you needed AI to\\n22:59 analyze the data and it was not a CH\\n23:02 chatboard it was not a summarize with AI\\n23:04 button or whatever you do to to use AI\\n23:07 was just that in the background and I\\n23:09 think this is the the most useful thing\\n23:12 uh for AI don't need to show everyone\\n23:15 that we using it and just do it and make\\n23:18 the whatever you're doing a little bit\\n23:21 more useful MH but also marketing if you\\n23:25 show people that you use AI it's e\\n23:28 easier to attract investment it is it's\\n23:30 easier to attract people I guess easier\\n23:33 to attract investment but is it easier\\n23:36 to attract the users because I think\\n23:37 that are two camps yeah people who like\\n23:39 everything with AI and people who\\n23:41 absolutely hate it right because I see\\n23:44 now like I live in Berlin and uh I see\\n23:48 that now if I take Subway I see posters\\n23:52 like banners Samsung now with AI and\\n23:56 like okay\\n23:59 everything needs AI now apparently but\\n24:02 do users need it okay they might need it\\n24:05 but they do they need to know that they\\n24:07 using\\n24:09 it like I'm curious what kind of because\\n24:12 like I imagine machine learning models\\n24:14 have been around in Mobile phones for\\n24:16 quite some time right yeah exactly so if\\n24:21 you are using an app where you can type\\n24:25 anything to set for pictures this is\\n24:27 using maff leing have to recognize what\\n24:29 is in the picture but you don't have to\\n24:30 tell people that this is ma learning or\\n24:33 a or whatever just a feature that\\n24:36 works I think Google tell that like in\\n24:40 their like when they advertise the\\n24:43 cameras I don't I guess their marketing\\n24:45 department is\\n24:46 not stupid so must probably works but\\n24:52 that's one that if if you need it yeah I\\n24:54 mean\\n24:56 yeah the\\n24:59 saying that something is built with AI\\n25:01 it's pretty much like saying that it was\\n25:03 built with\\n25:04 spark yeah right about it yeah it that's\\n25:08 just supposed to work right and um yeah\\n25:13 you wrote a lot of posts you said like\\n25:16 480 one of them was about um prompt\\n25:19 gening so can you tell us more about

in they\\n26:19 tell you what to do and they um they\\n26:21 they go away and watch they give you\\n26:23 their invoice and wash their hands of\\n26:26 the um\\n26:28 um of the consequences or the

we\\n26:40 take full accountability if it works or\\n26:41 not\\n26:42 um obviously so I mean in a nutshell\\n26:45 where is it called Consulting because to\\n26:46 me Consulting is actually\\n26:49 um a company has a question and then\\n26:51 they need to consult somebody on solving\\n26:53 the questions so they consult they get\\n26:55 input and then they go implement it I\\n26:57 guess this is

sometimes it's just\\n27:52 uh you know just difficult it really\\n27:55 depends on the client Okay so\\n27:59 first let me ask you about how you find\\n28:02 these clients so you said that your\\n28:04 clients are usually uh startups like\\n28:07 pre-seize startups or I don't know\\n28:08 seriously startups that do not\\n28:10 necessarily have uh do not have this\\n28:13 data infrastructure so they in order to\\n28:15 do cool things in the future they need\\n28:18 to get the basics first right so how do\\n28:21 you find these companies where do you\\n28:22 find them do you open uh I don't know uh\\n28:26 because it's called\\n28:28 like there are websites where you see\\n28:30 the client the crunch right or something\\n28:32 like that where you can yeah no so it's\\n28:35 uh it's it's it's it's a little bit\\n28:38 different I mean you know consulting or\\n28:40 freelancing or you know basically like\\n28:43 contractual based workers like at the\\n28:46 end of the day we're external Partners\\n28:47 or external providers external\\n28:50 contractors\\n28:51 um\\n28:52 it's a very much network based business\\n28:58 but it's not like you cannot just like\\n29:01 wait until your network gives you gigs\\n29:04 um you you meet so you need to help it a\\n29:06 little bit right so\\n29:09 um getting the first projects is is\\n29:11 usually the it's it's the most difficult\\n29:14 or whatever it wasn't that difficult\\n29:17 right I mean we got it we got it we got\\n29:19 when we \", 'video_id': 'rh_pE35m3vE'}, {'start': 37500, 'content': \"3 we

understood the project\\n36:55 you did before\\n36:57 um it had also like something geospatial\\n37:00 right and when you were looking for your\\n37:04 first freelance\\n37:06 job uh actually the the

happen\\n37:20 again here I don't know maybe my next\\n37:22 fre L will be exactly like like the\\n37:25 scenario but I think that's a a really\\n37:27 good good story like you learn a skill\\n37:30 in a project hands on and I mean forena\\n37:34 there's no expectation that you would\\n37:36 work 20 hours or 15 hours it's really\\n37:38 like if you have five hours in a week\\n37:41 just like a half a day or after work for\\n37:43 two or to three days you just join a\\n37:47 project and you work with other people\\n37:48 to try to come up with a solution it's a\\n37:51 very I think it's a cool way to learn\\n37:53 new skills and a lot less overwhelming\\n37:55 if you do like with a team mhm would you\\n37:59 say that uh it typically happens that\\n38:01 the skills you pick up uh on such\\n38:03 projects they are handon Hands-On skills\\n38:06 that translate to job skills I think so\\n38:10 first I\\n38:11 think I think everybody gives the same\\n38:13 advice when it comes to data science\\n38:14 like build your portfolio do this do do\\n38:17 that there are so many ways of doing\\n38:19 that right exactly there are a lot of\\n38:21 different ways of doing that but like as\\n38:23 I grow in my here I realize that people\\n38:26 are also looking for soft skills right\\n38:28 when they hire you they just don't want\\n38:30 to somebody who's great at their job but\\n38:33 cannot work with anybody else and I\\n38:35 think when you do projects like this you\\n38:37 are forced to pick up soft skills\\n38:39 because if you have 80 people working on\\n38:42 the same project you have to communicate\\n38:44 well you have to be able to follow up\\n38:46 what's going on you have to be able to\\n38:50 access resources and figure things on\\n38:52 your own to not be overwhelmed when you\\n38:55 open Slack and there are 30 messages on\\n38:58 one single Channel and you don't know\\n38:59 where to look for I think those it's\\n39:02 also a great place to develop those\\n39:03 skills because a lot of I think a lot of\\n39:06 engineering and data science also the\\n39:08 mindset that you applied to what you're\\n39:11 doing and the like if you were alone\\n39:14 you're working alone I'm sure that you\\n39:15 are developing very hard skills and very\\n39:17 technical skills but then maybe you\\n39:19 missing out on developing a little a\\n39:21 little bit more of the mindset and also\\n39:23 when you work alone you don't\\n39:24 necessarily know uh what are the\\n39:27 kind of good relevant skills it's true\\n39:30 and wh\", 'video_id':

long I think it's going to be data\\n22:17 engineering\\n22:19 again um so yeah uh so there is one of\\n22:22 the use cases obviously but I think the\\n22:25 most interesting things that you can do\\n22:27 with AI is when you don't don't even see\\n22:29 that this is AI like some report that\\n22:32 tells you some data based on text for\\n22:34 example I was doing a project when we\\n22:36 analyzing the reviews from uh from\\n22:41 Google and uh the goal was to find out\\n22:45 what works at a particular location of\\n22:48 the company source and what what doesn't\\n22:52 and create a report on this and it was\\n22:54 not screening to the user this is made\\n22:56 with AI but but was you needed AI to\\n22:59 analyze the data and it was not a CH\\n23:02 chatboard it was not a summarize with AI\\n23:04 button or whatever you do to to use AI\\n23:07 was just that in the background and I\\n23:09 think this is the the most useful thing\\n23:12 uh for AI don't need to show everyone\\n23:15 that we using it and just do it and make\\n23:18 the whatever you're doing a little bit\\n23:21 more useful MH but also marketing if you\\n23:25 show people that you use AI it's e\\n23:28 easier to attract investment it is it's\\n23:30 easier to attract people I guess easier\\n23:33 to attract investment but is it easier\\n23:36 to attract the users because I think\\n23:37 that are two camps yeah people who like\\n23:39 everything with AI and people who\\n23:41 absolutely hate it right because I see\\n23:44 now like I live in Berlin and uh I see\\n23:48 that now if I take Subway I see posters\\n23:52 like banners Samsung now with AI and\\n23:56 like okay\\n23:59 everything needs AI now apparently but\\n24:02 do users need it okay they might need it\\n24:05 but they do they need to know that they\\n24:07 using\\n24:09 it like I'm curious what kind of because\\n24:12 like I imagine machine learning models\\n24:14 have been around in Mobile phones for\\n24:16 quite some time right yeah exactly so if\\n24:21 you are using an app where you can type\\n24:25 anything to set for pictures this is\\n24:27 using maff leing have to recognize what\\n24:29 is in the picture but you don't have to\\n24:30 tell people that this is ma learning or\\n24:33 a or whatever just a feature that\\n24:36 works I think Google tell that like in\\n24:40 their like when they advertise the\\n24:43 cameras I don't I guess their marketing\\n24:45 department is\\n24:46 not stupid so must probably works but\\n24:52 that's one that if if you need it yeah I\\n24:54 mean\\n24:56 yeah the\\n24:59 saying that something is built with AI\\n25:01 it's pretty much like saying that it was\\n25:03 built with\\n25:04 spark yeah right about it yeah it that's\\n25:08 just supposed to work right and um yeah\\n25:13 you wrote a lot of posts you said like\\n25:16 480 one of them was about um prompt\\n25:19 gening so can you tell us more about the\\n25:22 content of this block post

have\\n40:24 to set them in perspective\\n40:26 um it can show how you adopt uh how\\n40:30 people adopt your product but it it\\n40:33 cannot show everything and it's it's\\n40:35 often a kind of

the trending GitHub\\n40:51 trending part and then this is how your\\n40:54 project can be found by other people and\\n40:56 is this how you discover projects\\n40:58 yourself you go to GitHub trending and\\n41:00 look at the projects there\\n41:02 and the problem there is that those\\n41:04 projects um also most of the times too\\n41:06 late for us as an investment uh right\\n41:09 because\\n41:11 um that's that's also what is like if\\n41:13 they have 5 000 stars for example and\\n41:15 more and they have a great team and they\\n41:17 have a great\\n41:18 um idea of how to\\n41:21 um how to\\n41:23 commercialize it and it's a big problem\\n41:25 most of the times they already have an\\n41:27 investment because\\n41:29 it is quite transparent like\\n41:34 so\\n41:35 um so it is great to discover the\\n41:37 projects that are all like still a\\n41:39 little smaller but have an engaging\\n41:41 community that have this kind of spike\\n41:44 in Stars after you invested it's better\\n41:46 than than before you invested right\\n41:49 um so uh yeah but it also depends on the\\n41:53 case\\n41:55 um and and who you're building for but\\n41:57 in general\\n41:59 um stars is is good and bad and and\\n42:02 um\\n42:04 you can track you can track it you can\\n42:06 you can look at it but it shouldn't be\\n42:08 like oh I invest only above 2 000 stars\\n42:12 and uh with this kind of star growth\\n42:14 rate and yeah\\n42:17 so if a project isn't trending for you\\n42:20 most likely it's already too late to\\n42:22 invest in this project how do you\\n42:24

if someone out there wants to be a\\n45:56 consultant i think and if that's their\\n45:58 reason they want to work on different\\n46:00 projects i would really urge them to ask\\n46:02 the company how many kind of different\\n46:04 projects their data scientists worked on\\n46:06 this year because sometimes there are no\\n46:08 projects and then you don't have a\\n46:10 project and then it's boring\\n46:12 so\\n46:13 this obviously doesn't happen in every\\n46:15 company\\n46:16 and also like you know they might tell\\n46:17 you oh we have many different industries\\n46:19 but if the country you're working in\\n46:21 does not have that many different\\n46:22 industries then you are stuck with the\\n46:24 same industries at the end of the day\\n46:26 anyways uh so those things are quite\\n46:29 like nuanced i think uh it's really easy\\n46:32 to say like oh yeah i work in many\\n46:33 different companies in many different\\n46:34 industries but the reality might not be\\n46:37 that way so i think that's something to\\n46:38 look out for\\n46:40 yeah in case of ibm or maybe not let you\\n46:42 say uh let's not use ibm but let's say\\n46:45 there is a company in the

there\\n46:58 in this geographical region because this\\n47:00 is where the company works right no of\\n47:02 course yeah so then then you are uh\\n47:04 definitely dependent on the region that\\n47:06 you're working in uh but\\n47:08 netherlands actually quite we were quite\\n47:09 lucky to have belgium and luxembourg\\n47:12 included the netherlands itself also has\\n47:14 like a lot of different industries uh\\n47:16 included in them uh so that was quite\\n47:20 lucky of me but i i've definitely heard\\n47:22 people for example like in turkey\\n47:26 i had some friends who were struggling\\n47:28 to find projects and that is not the\\n47:30 most fun place to be\\n47:32 okay and there is a related question\\n47:35 do you think it's better to be a\\n47:37 specialist as a data scientist or to be\\n47:39 a person with a broad skill set\\n47:42 uh my opinion on this is that i like to\\n47:44 be a generalist and i like to know a lot\\n47:46 about everything well a little bit about\\n47:48 everything\\n47:50 but mainly it's just kind of my\\n47:52 personality because i like learning new\\n47:54 things and\\n47:55 uh i guess i do not really have the\\n47:57 patience to\\n47:58 be a specialized person\\n48:00 but uh i i wouldn't say one of them is\\n48:02 better than the other one as i said it\\n48:04 really depends on the kind of work you\\n48:06 want to do if you're like i want to be\\n48:07 an nlp expert well there you have it you\\n48:10 have to really specialize in that area\\n48:12 but if you're like you know what i like\\n48:13 this data science thing

see my\\n1:57 background is in U math and science\\n2:00 um my bachelor and master were in\\n2:03 applied math um I always applying that\\n2:05 towards various engineering Sciences so\\n2:07 really passionate about just like the\\n2:09 the application of math and data towards\\n2:12 um various real world scenarios and\\n2:15 applications um let's see I started my\\n2:18 career after various internships in um\\n2:21 Academia and Industry um I I started my\\n2:25 um full-time career at Microsoft um\\n2:28 originally I was in the veler division\\n2:30 um working on Visual Studio the C and\\n2:33 Visual Basic languages um the I was\\n2:36 working on the the IDE and user\\n2:39 experience around those languages as\\n2:40 well and so that was a great opportunity\\n2:42 just to to Really while I was working on\\n2:44 a product that was catered by developer\\n2:47 um catered For developers to learn about\\n2:49 you know building software in the tech\\n2:50 industry and all the various best\\n2:52 practices that come with that um and\\n2:54 it's been interesting actually to see\\n2:55 how some of those can be applied towards\\n2:57 data science the way that we um run data\\n3:00 science projects as well um as my role\\n3:03 there evolved from working product um to\\n3:06 looking at customer feedback and then\\n3:08 over time increasingly you know Big Data\\n3:10 was growing in the industry and we were\\n3:11 interested in more of the quantitative\\n3:13 in addition to the qualitative feedback\\n3:15 um then I started working on our\\n3:17 Telemetry systems um our product\\n3:19 analytics\\n3:20 performance um as well as things like\\n3:22 our overall uh metrics that we were\\n3:24 using to run the business and our\\n3:26 various business reviews um and then\\n3:28 data science techniques we started\\n3:30 employing to um understand the the usage\\n3:33 patterns of our users as well um so I\\n3:35 was uh doing that role within data\\n3:38 within visual studio for some time and\\n3:40 then as the cloud was growing and we\\n3:42 were increasing our our focus on Azure\\n3:44 within the company then I moved to um a\\n3:46 data science Organization for Azure and\\n3:49 I was in that or um That Grew over\\n3:51 several years um and and and was leading\\n3:54 a data science team within our what\\n3:55 we're calling Microsoft cloud data\\n3:57 Sciences so again we had a lot of focus\\n3:59 on Azure um over time as or was growing\\n4:02 but also started working on um like the\\n4:04 intersection with Microsoft teams um\\n4:07 powerbi and other cloud services as well\\n4:10 um so in that role you know we we were\\n4:12 doing data science for the product\\n4:14 looking at and the retention of\\n4:16 different services and

scientists worked on\\n46:06 this year because sometimes there are no\\n46:08 projects and then you don't have a\\n46:10 project and then it's boring\\n46:12 so\\n46:13 this obviously doesn't happen in every\\n46:15 company\\n46:16 and also like you know they might tell\\n46:17 you oh we have many different industries\\n46:19 but if the country you're working in\\n46:21 does not have that many different\\n46:22 industries then you are stuck with the\\n46:24 same industries at the end of the day\\n46:26 anyways uh so those things are quite\\n46:29 like nuanced i think uh it's really easy\\n46:32 to say like oh yeah i work in many\\n46:33 different companies in many different\\n46:34 industries but the reality might not be\\n46:37 that way so i think that's something to\\n46:38 look out for\\n46:40 yeah in case of ibm or maybe not let you\\n46:42 say uh let's not use ibm but let's say\\n46:45 there is a company in the netherlands\\n46:47 who works who works with benny lux\\n46:50 companies right belgium netherlands and\\n46:52 luxembourg right so i guess you're kind\\n46:55 of limited to whatever interest is there\\n46:58 in this geographical region because this\\n47:00 is where the company works right no of\\n47:02 course yeah so then then you are uh\\n47:04 definitel\", 'video_id': 'oUycqtMoYr8'}], tool_call_id='call_sUjoRbxU0H5s5NimcQ7QLtPC',

started\\n1:41 off to a good start\\n1:43 yeah thanks for joining us so before we\\n1:45 go into our main topic of product\\n1:48 management let's start with your\\n1:49 background can you tell us about your\\n1:51 career journey so far absolutely um so i\\n1:55 started in manufacturing i'm an\\n1:57 industrial engineer i also have a\\n1:59 master's in engineering management with\\n2:01 a focus around supply chain and business\\n2:05 so in manufacturing at it i had the\\n2:07 opportunity to\\n2:09 rotate around different positions\\n2:10 whether it's supply chain ops management\\n2:13 quality safety management uh then in\\n2:16 manufacturing also i had a chance to be\\n2:18 a product manager uh responsible for\\n2:21 value chain uh optimization and\\n2:24 especially pricing optimization uh which\\n2:27 was very fun and that was before i\\n2:28 joined amazon\\n2:30 uh in in\\n2:32 you know building some systems that are\\n2:34 either ai based or non-ai based uh to\\n2:37 make sure that i keep customers safe\\n2:39 when they go online and purchase uh the\\n2:42 products so\\n2:45 so you were managing actual products uh\\n2:48 i mean physical products before that\\n2:50 right\\n2:51 yeah yeah before that it was uh physical\\n2:53 products um understanding the value\\n2:56 chain from the time you\\n2:58 uh\\n2:59 you know put your strategy for\\n3:00 purchasing raw materials to put a\\n3:03 strategy behind where you want to\\n3:04 manufacture these products how much it\\n3:06 costs you to\\n3:08 produce them which are the distribution\\n3:10 centers\\n3:11 um the price of the products um and then\\n3:14 the marketing strategy and all that\\n3:16 stuff and all of these\\n3:18 uh\\n3:19 strategies in in\\n3:22 data that you're pulling is the role is\\n3:24 to\\n3:26 optimize the margin for all of these\\n3:29 products given that you're creating\\n3:31 value for\\n3:32 the customers that you serve and it was\\n3:34 a b2b\\n3:35 company uh in the chemical industry so\\n3:38 that was quite interesting to be able to\\n3:41 collaborate with different groups from a\\n3:43 commercial uh\\n3:45 team of sales folks\\n3:48 and also\\n3:49 finance and also you have\\n3:52 marketing\\n3:53 transportation\\n3:55 teams\\n3:56 and\\n3:57 it's uh it was good to be uh kind of in\\n4:00 the middle to coordinate all of this to\\n4:02 make sure that the uh\\n4:05 execution\\n4:07 of each department was\\n4:09 done on time to deliver uh exactly what\\n4:12 the customer is expected to\\n4:15 receive or be on so\\n4:19 so product manager is not a t-specific\\n4:22 role right so it's uh\\n4:24 no\\n4:25 i would say yeah i would say it varies\\n4:28 uh by\\n4:30 department even uh it's not only varies\\n4:33 by\\n4:34 a company it's like inside of a company\\n4:37 they could be different roles a product\\n4:39 manager can take um\\n4:41 my latest at the manufacturing setting\\n4:43 as a product manager was developing\\n4:46 what i call data products\\n4:48 uh what i call data products is kind of\\n4:50 like a hub aggregator\\n4:52 of data \", 'video_id': 'p4wg0Vd2uD4'}, {'start': 16500, 'content': \"ry to gather a data set\\n16:20 from the open source so we're trying to\\n16:22 figure out the missionary products that\\n16:24 exists in the open source and analyze\\n16:27 those uh to the different artifacts to\\n16:30 understand what is actually happening in\\n16:31 those kind of products in open source so\\n16:34 that's an ongoing project I'm yeah\\n16:36 working still working on that trying to\\n16:37 wrap that up I do have a data set a\\n16:40 small uh data that I say which I'll\\n16:42 publish soon I I hope that will be\\n16:45 useful but yeah that's a different\\n16:47 research that's going on and I also I\\n16:50 have been working on some um about this\\n16:54 data set I'm just curious before we go\\n16:56 to the other part of your research I'm\\n17:00 just curious what is exactly in this\\n17:02 data set so I understand that the goal\\n17:04 is to understand how different people\\n17:08 collaborate and then you selected open\\n17:11 source because it's easy to get data\\n17:15 right or I got it completely wrong\\n17:22 so it's not just about collaboration\\n17:24 it's also about the product itself so\\n17:28 the products as I say the products that\\n17:31 we build in software engineering are\\n17:32 slightly different from the products\\n17:34 that we have in machine learning\\n17:36 so uh we only try to uh so we only have\\n17:42 information about these products from\\n17:44 people but what we want and that we want\\n17:47 to study it ourselves we want to look at\\n17:50 the project look at the project for\\n17:52 ourselves we want to look at the uh how\\n17:54 people are from different backgrounds\\n17:56 are working with different parts\\n17:57 ourselves what are the good qualities\\n17:59 are same one one part of it and then\\n18:03 um so for this kind of artifacts we uh\\n18:06 either we need access to uh industry\\n18:08 products or we can do the interviews as\\n18:10 I said so that's why we want to\\n18:13 um collect data set from the open source\\n18:15 and provide it to the researchers and\\n18:18 publish it somewhere where people can\\n18:20 really have their different research\\n18:22 questions and try to analyze those\\n18:24 through those data sets so those data\\n18:27 said will have the products the uh the\\n18:30 GitHub because where they have some\\n18:32 machine learning products which is again\\n18:34 not we're not looking for the like toy\\n18:36 projects like the maybe small notebook\\n18:39 course or something we're looking at\\n18:40 industry level products and those\\n18:42 products will have some machine learning\\n18:44 components so that it can be called a\\n18:46 missionary system so yeah we're trying\\n18:48 to find a list of those in open source\\n18:50 especially I'm working on in GitHub\\n18:52 right now trying to figure out what are\\n18:54 the products that GitHub have\\n18:56 um yes I'll uh it's still ongoing but to\\n19:00 give you a brief hint that it's not\\n19:03 really much out there in open source so\\n19:05 yeah I was going to ask you that because\\n19:07 in our community uh I quite often see a\\n19:11 question like I want to un\", 'video_id': '35Ch8xL2SA8'}, {'start': 6000, 'content': \" speaker or or be a\\n6:15 frequent speaker where they're out\\n6:17 speaking uh for my role it's\\n6:20 very much focused around um\\n6:23 not just evangelizing the data robot\\n6:25 product but figuring out how to\\n6:27 evangelize ai so how do we get companies\\n6:29 excited about using ai even if they\\n6:31 don't want to use\\n6:32 our particular product how do we get\\n6:33 people\\n6:36 you know thinking about the art of the\\n6:38 possible so how can we stir the creative\\n6:40 juices and get them thinking about what\\n6:42 could they do this year with ai\\n6:45 for some people i joke and say i'm the\\n6:47 ai missionary so i'm\\n6:49 you know if you didn't think your\\n6:50 company needed ai i\\n6:52 there's a good chance i can convince you\\n6:53 otherwise um with the right format\\n6:56 and to be a little bit more specific i\\n6:59 see evangelism\\n7:00 sitting in between product and\\n7:02 engineering and marketing\\n7:04 so marketing for a tech company is very\\n7:06 complicated because\\n7:08 a lot of marketing can be it's technical\\n7:12 so you have to you never want to have\\n7:14 marketing that feels\\n7:16 misleading or it's incorrect or\\n7:18 embarrassing because\\n7:20 for people that are traditionally\\n7:21 marketing they might not have the\\n7:22 technical background\\n7:24 to get the messaging right and so a lot\\n7:27 of times i'm reviewing\\n7:28 blog content and some of the messaging\\n7:30 stuff but\\n7:31 for me but i think that's a lot of fun\\n7:33 because\\n7:34 it feels like it's a tough challenge so\\n7:38 if you and i are competing on writing a\\n7:40 blog article\\n7:41 about ai or if anyone listening if we're\\n7:43 competing together\\n7:45 how can you and this all goes back to\\n7:47 speaking so how can you create\\n7:49 content that changes an audience or\\n7:52 moves them emotionally and the criticism\\n7:54 i'll throw out to end\\n7:55 this rant is um the common criticism is\\n7:58 people\\n7:59 fall into the rational mindset and\\n8:01 that's the features and speeds\\n8:03 so i want you to like my product because\\n8:05 it has one more feature\\n8:06 than the competition or i want you to\\n8:08 buy my hardware because it's a little\\n8:10 faster\\n8:10 than nvidia or intel and\\n8:13 that's a very weak argument because\\n8:16 that's not why\\n8:18 humans don't humans like to make\\n8:20 emotional decisions and then they like\\n8:22 to confirm their emotional decisions\\n8:24 with\\n8:24 rational insights the reverse doesn't\\n8:27 really work to just sell you on rational\\n8:30 arguments it's\\n8:31 yeah so i so i love studying that part\\n8:33 of it so\\n8:34 this is like your role is to speak\\n8:38 in public then like\\n8:41 promote ai promote your company as well\\n8:44 and uh did you also say you kind of you\\n8:47 are an editor in a blog so you also\\n8:50 review\\n8:50 the review yeah and we also um\\n8:54 we're also starting up a program this\\n8:56 year where

switch to data engineering entirely\\n6:23 yeah you have any ideas why it's\\n6:25 happening\\n6:26 um generally the the thing that\\n6:29 generally happens is\\n6:30 when you look back a few years and i've\\n6:32 i've saw this everywhere\\n6:34 people were starting with data science\\n6:36 they they got themselves\\n6:38 they hired data scientists they had some\\n6:40 data laying around\\n6:42 and they basically analyzed the data i\\n6:45 had a few\\n6:46 business ideas we could do this we could\\n6:48 do that and then\\n6:49 they got to the science data science\\n6:52 track and they solved the problems but\\n6:55 at some point\\n6:57 that's where we are getting more and\\n6:58 more and more is they people realize\\n7:01 okay\\n7:01 now i have this i have this analytics\\n7:04 methods i

see a lot more\\n7:16 engineering\\n7:17 is people leave the stage of like a\\n7:20 proof of concept and they go\\n7:22 they get more into this stage of okay\\n7:24 now we need to build something we need\\n7:25 to make money or we want to make money\\n7:27 we want to build a platform\\n7:30 that's that's the what i currently see\\n7:33 so basically data science uh\\n7:36 becomes more mature and

plumbing and building pipelines\\n3:24 let's start with your background can you\\n3:26 tell us about your career journey so far\\n3:29 yeah sure yeah my name is andreas cut\\n3:33 i'm in i'm coming from germany and\\n3:36 i'm i've been basically within computer\\n3:40 science all my life i\\n3:41 always loved computers and i started\\n3:43 like many people playing or\\n3:45 playing on computer computer games and\\n3:47 then i got into actual computer science\\n3:49 and studied computer science\\n3:52 after that i made a quick detour towards\\n3:56 sap consulting but that doesn't that was\\n3:59 nothing that wasn't\\n4:00 my thing and i came back into the\\n4:03 uh the computer science realm where i\\n4:05 started as a\\n4:06 as a software engineer and\\n4:10 basically in a project where um\\n4:13 where it was about the inter the iot\\n4:17 but the industrial iot so we were\\n4:20 working on\\n4:21 getting machine data and analyzing\\n4:23 machine data\\n4:25 and so basically uh that's where i got\\n4:28 into the topic of um\\n4:32 where where does uh or how i got into\\n4:35 big data big data was a thing back then\\n4:38 and everybody was talking about\\n4:39 big data and we're doing big data but i\\n4:42 actually had the problem that there were\\n4:44 so much\\n4:45 data coming coming around or coming in\\n4:48 that we yeah that the the standard tools\\n4:51 didn't work anymore\\n4:53 so i need to find solutions different\\n4:57 solutions to actually\\n4:58 yeah work this out and back then i\\n5:01 started with hadoop so\\n5:03 uh hadoop was really the the thing back\\n5:06 then\\n5:07 and uh that really turned out really\\n5:10 good\\n5:11 and so that's how i got into into the\\n5:13 into the field back then\\n5:15 big data now now data engineering

{'start': 6000, 'content': \"u know other things like\\n6:08 within a team deciding for some approach\\n6:11 or sometimes conflict resolutions right\\n6:14 and one of the most important tasks for\\n6:16 data hinging manager or any engineering\\n6:18 manager should be prioritizing the task\\n6:21 right you have lot of things coming on\\n6:23 your way right from various stakeholders\\n6:26 so how you\\n6:27 prioritize that that's one of the key\\n6:30 responsibilities as well\\n6:32 so you work on a data platform some\\n6:35 internal data platform right and you\\n6:37 manage the engineers right\\n6:40 and because the the setup we have to\\n6:43 elix is we have engineering managers\\n6:47 and\\n6:48 people who report to the engineering\\n6:50 managers are back-end engineers\\n6:52 front-end engineers and data engineers\\n6:55 right so\\n6:57 we don't have a role that is called data\\n6:58 engineering manager and usually there is\\n7:01 just an engineering manager who manages\\n7:03 the engineers\\n7:05 and i'm wondering why do we have this um\\n7:08 maybe because we work in so-called\\n7:11 feature teams like a team that works on\\n7:13 a specific\\n7:15 part of a product and everyone works on\\n7:17 the same thing while in your case your\\n7:19 team takes care of the other platform so\\n7:21 everyone on your team is a data engineer\\n7:23 right\\n7:24 absolutely yeah\\n7:26 correct yeah\\n7:28 and i guess it's helpful for data\\n7:30 engineers to have a manager who is also\\n7:32 a data engineer or at least who can\\n7:34 relate to the problems they have because\\n7:36 this is how they can\\n7:38 think what is the best way for the\\n7:41 development for coaching right and if we\\n7:44 have just a usual\\n7:46 engineering manager they might not\\n7:48 know in a lot of details about you know\\n7:51 new data tools and so on right that's\\n7:53 where you come into play into picture\\n7:56 and then this is you if you give\\n7:58 suggestions to people you tell them what\\n8:00 is good to learn right\\n8:02 yeah i think you mentioned very valid\\n8:04 point right um this role when i talk to\\n8:07 other engineering managers i realized\\n8:08 that as a data engineering manager you\\n8:11 have to\\n8:12 be in line with some hands-on activities\\n8:15 as well so you should know what your\\n8:16 team is working upon at the code level\\n8:18 sometimes right\\n8:20 so that's that's how i spend my time\\n8:22 like i wear two heads here so 50 of the\\n8:25 time i am working as an individual\\n8:26 contributor as a data engineer in my\\n8:28 team and remaining fifty percent i am uh\\n8:31 managing the team right\\n8:33 so\\n8:33 as you mentioned it uh correctly because\\n8:35 uh sometimes when you when you have\\n8:38 technical brainstorming you know or\\n8:40 maybe defining road maps then your\\n8:42 technical skill sets really comes into\\n8:44 play\\n8:45 so a data engineering manager should\\n8:48 should definitely you know have some\\n8:50 hands on not only just managing people\\n8:54 how do you find time to actually do this\\n8:56 like how large is your team

your\\n2:24 background\\n2:25 can you tell us a bit about your career\\n2:26 journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part specifically\\n3:50 in the big data engineering team\\n3:53 yeah i've heard that in advertising\\n3:55 there are there is so much data\\n3:57 that this data engineering big data\\n4:00 engineering becomes really important\\n4:01 because\\n4:02 these companies every day gets get\\n4:04 terabytes of data and they need to\\n4:06 effectively\\n4:07 uh process this data right yeah\\n4:10 and also what kind of makes uh the\\n4:12

theory\\n4:29 behind it\\n4:30 but also i realized i kind of miss more\\n4:32 the engineering parts of it and\\n4:34 that was also the time when data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data scientists but also\\n4:40 people that actually before come before\\n4:42 them and\\n4:43 make data available for data science\\n4:45 because that's at the time was a common\\n4:47 frustration for data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native

native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and i realized eventually that this was\\n5:28 kind of a dead end for me\\n5:30 and so i\\n5:32 i remembered my software engineering\\n5:34 background which i actually enjoyed\\n5:36 except it was a repetitive and then\\n5:38 at the time i was speaking to somebody\\n5:40 at thoughtworks she was the first data\\n5:42 scientist at the thoughtworks in germany\\n5:44 at the time and she told me that\\n5:46 thoughtworks was planning to expand its\\n5:48 data engineering offering and what i'd\\n5:49 be

engineering entirely\\n6:23 yeah you have any ideas why it's\\n6:25 happening\\n6:26 um generally the the thing that\\n6:29 generally happens is\\n6:30 when you look back a few years and i've\\n6:32 i've saw this everywhere\\n6:34 people were starting with data science\\n6:36 they they got themselves\\n6:38 they hired data scientists they had some\\n6:40 data laying around\\n6:42 and they basically analyzed the data i\\n6:45 had a few\\n6:46 business ideas we could do this we could\\n6:48 do that and then\\n6:49 they got to the science data science\\n6:52 track and they solved the problems but\\n6:55 at some point\\n6:57 that's where we are getting more and\\n6:58 more and more is they people realize\\n7:01 okay\\n7:01 now i have this i have this analytics\\n7:04 methods i have i solved the problem but\\n7:06 now i need to automate it now i need to\\n7:08 build something around it\\n7:10 how to actually bring this into\\n7:13 production\\n7:13 and that's that's why we see a lot more\\n7:16 engineering\\n7:17 is people leave the stage of like a\\n7:20 proof of concept and they go\\n7:22 they get more into this stage of okay\\n7:24 now we need to build something we need\\n7:25 to make money or we want to make money\\n7:27 we want to build a platform\\n7:30 that's that's the what i currently see\\n7:33 so basically data science uh\\n7:36 becomes more mature and companies\\n7:39 realize that okay\\n7:41 it's not just a one-time thing where we\\n7:43 do something jupiter notebook and throw\\n7:45 it away\\n7:46 right we need to automate it we need to\\n7:48 build those data pipelines\\n7:49 and that's why people realize that okay\\n7:53 this is what data enginee\", 'video_id': 'IrZPAG6OBqo'}, {'start': 3000, 'content': \"but it's a huge mess when\\n3:10 done wrong so build like plumbing\\n3:12 so that's and also it fits very good\\n3:15 with with pipelines\\n3:16 right so yeah indeed yeah so before we\\n3:20 go into our main topic of\\n3:21 uh plumbing and building pipelines\\n3:24 let's start with your background can you\\n3:26 tell us about your career journey so far\\n3:29 yeah sure yeah my name is andreas cut\\n3:33 i'm in i'm coming from germany and\\n3:36 i'm i've been basically within computer\\n3:40 science all my life i\\n3:41 always loved computers and i started\\n3:43 like many people playing or\\n3:45 playing on computer computer games and\\n3:47 then i got into actual computer science\\n3:49 and studied computer science\\n3:52 after that i made a quick detour towards\\n3:56 sap consulting but that doesn't that was\\n3:59 nothing that wasn't\\n4:00 my thing and i came back into the\\n4:03 uh the computer science realm where i\\n4:05 started as a\\n4:06 as a software engineer and\\n4:10 basically in a project where um\\n4:13 where it was about the inter the iot\\n4:17 but the industrial iot so we were\\n4:20 working on\\n4:21 getting machine data and analyzing\\n4:23 machine data\\n4:25 and so basically uh that's where i got\\n4:28 into the topic of um\\n4:32 where where does uh or how i got into\\n4:35 big data big data was a thing back then\\n4:38 and everybody was talking about\\n4:39 big data and we're doing big data but i\\n4:42 actually had the problem that there were\\n4:44 so much\\n4:45 data coming coming around or coming in\\n4:48 that we yeah that the the standard tools\\n4:51 didn't work anymore\\n4:53 so i need to find solutions different\\n4:57 solutions to actually\\n4:58 yeah work this out and back then i\\n5:01 started with hadoop so\\n5:03 uh hadoop was really the the thing back\\n5:06 then\\n5:07 and uh that really turned out really\\n5:10 good\\n5:11 and so that's how i got into into the\\n5:13 into the field back then\\n5:15 big data now now data engineering data\\n5:17 science\\n5:18 i became then i switched basically\\n5:22 to data engineer became a team lead for\\n5:25 data engineering\\n5:28 this year i started leading a data lab\\n5:31 but since this month i'm basically went\\n5:34 full time with\\n5:35 teaching data engineering with my with\\n5:37 my academy at learndataengineering.com\\n5:40 okay so yeah yeah that's how i got here\\n5:43 yeah we'll talk a bit\\n5:45 about your uh about your course as well\\n5:48 it seems like there is a lot of interest\\n5:51 in data engineering these days\\n5:53 and you're probably so since\\n5:56 you said that you work with hadoop i\\n5:59 think you're in this area for quite a\\n6:01 while\\n6:02 um so i think now these days there is a\\n6:05 lot of a lot more interest\\n6:07 than even a couple of years ago so\\n6:10 now i talk to some data scientists and\\n6:12 they\\n6:13 they say that they want to get into data\\n6:15 engineering they want to start building\\n6:17 data pipelines\\n6:18 not just learn to build data pipelines\\n6:20 but switch to data engineering entirely\\n6:23 yeah you have any ideas why it's\\n6:25 happening\\n6:26 um generally the\", 'video_id': 'IrZPAG6OBqo'}, {'start': 6000, 'content': \"u know other things like\\n6:08 within a team deciding for some approach\\n6:11 or sometimes conflict resolutions right\\n6:14 and one of the most important tasks for\\n6:16 data hinging manager or any engineering\\n6:18 manager should be prioritizing the task\\n6:21 right you have lot of things coming on\\n6:23 your way right from various stakeholders\\n6:26 so how you\\n6:27 prioritize that that's one of the key\\n6:30 responsibilities as well\\n6:32 so you work on a data platform some\\n6:35 internal data platform right and you\\n6:37 manage the engineers right\\n6:40 and because the the setup we have to\\n6:43 elix is we have engineering managers\\n6:47 and\\n6:48 people who report to the engineering\\n6:50 managers are back-end engineers\\n6:52 front-end engineers and data engineers\\n6:55 right so\\n6:57 we don't have a role that is called data\\n6:58 engineering manager and usually there is\\n7:01 just an engineering manager who manages\\n7:03 the engineers\\n7:05 and i'm wondering why do we have this um\\n7:08 maybe because we work in so-called\\n7:11 feature teams like a team that works on\\n7:13 a specific\\n7:15 part of a product and everyone works on\\n7:17 the same thing while in your case your\\n7:19 team takes care of the other platform so\\n7:21 everyone on your team is a data engineer\\n7:23 right\\n7:24 absolutely yeah\\n7:26 correct yeah\\n7:28 and i guess it's helpful for data\\n7:30 engineers to have a manager who is also\\n7:32 a data engineer or at least who can\\n7:34 relate to the problems they have because\\n7:36 this is how they can\\n7:38 think what is the best way for the\\n7:41 development for coaching right and if we\\n7:44 have just a usual\\n7:46 engineering manager they might not\\n7:48 know in a lot of details about you know\\n7:51 new data tools and so on right that's\\n7:53 where you come into play into picture\\n7:56 and then this is you if you give\\n7:58 suggestions to people you tell them what\\n8:00 is good to learn right\\n8:02 yeah i think you mentioned very valid\\n8:04 point right um this role when i talk to\\n8:07 other engineering managers i realized\\n8:08 that as a data engineering manager you\\n8:11 have to\\n8:12 be in line with some hands-on activities\\n8:15 as well so you should know what your\\n8:16 team is working upon at the code level\\n8:18 sometimes right\\n8:20 so that's that's how i spend my time\\n8:22 like i wear two heads here so 50 of the\\n8:25 time i am working as an individual\\n8:26 contributor as a data engineer in my\\n8:28 team and remaining fifty percent i am uh\\n8:31 managing the team right\\n8:33 so\\n8:33 as you mentioned it uh correctly because\\n8:35 uh sometimes when you when you have\\n8:38 technical brainstorming you know or\\n8:40 maybe defining road maps then your\\n8:42 technical skill sets really comes into\\n8:44 play\\n8:45 so a data engineering manager should\\n8:48 should definitely you know have some\\n8:50 hands on not only just managing people\\n8:54 how do you find time to actually do this\\n8:56 like how large is your team how many\\n8:58 people do you make so currently uh\\n9:00 in i manage eight people s\", 'video_id': 'FljnbUQ796w'}, {'start': 1500, 'content': \"during the interview and that's\\n1:33 all i

uh\\n1:57 big data engineers and data scientists\\n2:00 and we have special guests today\\n2:02 rexella ruxlana works as a big data\\n2:04 engineer\\n2:05 in uh captify right yeah and\\n2:09 uh yeah so today she will talk about\\n2:13 the role of a data engineer and data\\n2:14 scientist welcome\\n2:17 thank you before we go before we start\\n2:20 with our\\n2:21 main topic let's talk a bit about your\\n2:24 background\\n2:25 can you tell us a bit about your career\\n2:26 journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part specifically\\n3:50 in the big data engineering team\\n3:53 yeah i've heard that in advertising\\n3:55 there are there is so much data\\n3:57 that this data engineering big data\\n4:00 engineering becomes really important\\n4:01 because\\n4:02 these companies every day gets get\\n4:04 terabytes of data and they need to\\n4:06 effectively\\n4:07 uh process this data right yeah\\n4:10 and also what kind of makes uh the\\n4:12 solution of creptify unique\\n4:14 is data insights which are obviously\\n4:17 delivered to the help of\\n4:19 big data engineering team by having\\n4:21 different\\n4:22 sources of data and ways to transform\\n4:24 this data and deliver it to the clients\\n4:27 so what do you do at work uh what do you\\n4:29 usually do\\n4:30 as a big data engineer so my main\\n4:33 responsibility is building

model but i didn't\\n4:22 really understand what's going on which\\n4:23 is partially due to the fact that my\\n4:24 mathematics background isn't that strong\\n4:27 so i didn't never really got the theory\\n4:29 behind it\\n4:30 but also i realized i kind of miss more\\n4:32 the engineering parts of it and\\n4:34 that was also the time when data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data scientists but also\\n4:40 people that actually before come before\\n4:42 them and\\n4:43 make data available for data science\\n4:45 because that's at the time was a common\\n4:47 frustration for data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native instruments to be\\n4:58 one of their first data engineers\\n5:01 i did that for a while um i still had\\n5:04 the ambition back then to transition\\n5:05 back into data science but i left native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and i realized eventually that this was\\n5:28 kind of a dead end for me\\n5:30 and so i\\n5:32 i remembered my software engineering\\n5:34 background which i actually enjoyed\\n5:36 except it was a repetitive and then\\n5:38 at the time i was speaking to somebody\\n5:40 at thoughtworks she was the first data\\n5:42 scientist at the thoughtworks in germany\\n5:44 at the time and she told me that\\n5:46 thoughtworks was planning to expand its\\n5:48 data engineering offering and what i'd\\n5:49 be interested in\\n5:52 in becoming the solidworks germany's\\n5:54 first data engineer and help her expand\\n5:56 that offering and i thought it was\\n5:58 really exciting and\\n5:59 especially since southwark is a great\\n6:01 place for really learning good software\\n6:03 engineering practices which as a data\\n6:05 engineer is always frustrated as a data\\n6:07 scientist that always frustrated me that\\n6:09 the quality of the code and the\\n6:11 collaboration wasn't as good as i was i\\n6:13 remembered it from my back in\\n6:14 engineering days\\n6:16 and so i jumped on that and that's when\\n6:17 i finally decided to stay in data\\n6:19 engineering which i had done on and off\\n6:21 before\\n6:23 and then then yeah after that was i went\\n6:26 to where i'm now it was my transfers and\\n6:28 built up data engineering there which\\n6:29 way i'm now heading a team\\n6:32 that's quite a story and thanks for\\n6:33 sharing so uh what i also wanted to ask\\n6:36 you the next question i prepared is that\\n6:38 you were a data scientist and then you\\n6:40 switched to data engineering and i\\n6:41 wanted to ask why i think you partly\\n6:43 answered that so you said

to\\n18:08 discuss like how related they are to\\n18:12 successful machine learning\\n18:15 projects uh very very uh well\\n18:18 intertwined um\\n18:21 so especially with machine learning uh\\n18:24 like uh you know any kind of project but\\n18:26 specifically machine learning one of the\\n18:28 challenges with machine learning is just\\n18:30 how complex it is and how many how much\\n18:33 support you need from every part of the\\n18:35 business for machine learning to work\\n18:37 you know any software developer will\\n18:39 tell you like getting support for a new\\n18:41 project is difficult and that's\\n18:43 absolutely true but the level of support\\n18:46 that you need to execute a machine\\n18:48 learning project that actually works and\\n18:50 provides value is you know on I I'm\\n18:53 going to pull out a number here but\\n18:54 maybe 3x what a typical software project\\n18:57 does and that's because there's so much\\n19:00 level of care that needs to be involved\\n19:02 with generating data transforming it\\n19:04 setting up that pipeline building the\\n19:06 model building the prediction pipeline\\n19:08 there's just so many things that can go\\n19:09 wrong and so much effort that needs to\\n19:12 be taken that in order to allocate the\\n19:15 resources for that you have to have a\\n19:18 lot of motivation and a lot of buying\\n19:20 from stakeholders so being able to sell\\n19:24 is very crucial skill of pretty much any\\n19:27 machine learning person\\n19:29 because in order to gain enough support\\n19:32 for your projects you have to be able to\\n19:34 get people excited about the potential\\n19:36 of what of what you're going to build\\n19:38 and so that's something that I learned\\n19:40 you know maybe a year or two into my\\n19:42 career in machine learning was that I\\n19:44 was a a lot of the projects I wanted to\\n19:46 build were dead in the water because I\\n19:48 couldn't get enough support so what I\\n19:50 started to do was to figure out the the\\n19:52 ways in order to generate excitement and\\n19:55 get that support that I that I needed\\n19:57 one example is uh being able to uh get\\n20:02 to a proof of concept that I can uh that\\n20:05 I can use in a demo very quickly to show\\n20:08 on like a real sample data set like a\\n20:10 prediction in real time that is very\\n20:13 effective at getting interest between\\n20:15 people because they can see like the the\\n20:16 potential value of it but going back to\\n20:18 your question so like how do these\\n20:20 skills intertwine with successful\\n20:22 machine learning or you know the rules\\n20:24 of machine learning you have to\\n20:27 understand that like machine learning\\n20:28 you don't just get handed machine\\n20:29

order to gain enough support\\n19:32 for your projects you have to be able to\\n19:34 get people excited about the potential\\n19:36 of what of what you're going to build\\n19:38 and so that's something that I learned\\n19:40 you know maybe a year or two into my\\n19:42 career in machine learning was that I\\n19:44 was a a lot of the projects I wanted to\\n19:46 build were dead in the water because I\\n19:48 couldn't get enough support so what I\\n19:50 started to do was to figure out the the\\n19:52 ways in order to generate excitement and\\n19:55 get that support that I that I needed\\n19:57 one example is uh being able to uh get\\n20:02 to a proof of concept that I can uh that\\n20:05 I can use in a demo very quickly to show\\n20:08 on like a real sample data set like a\\n20:10 prediction in real time that is very\\n20:13 effective at getting interest between\\n20:15 people because they can see like the the\\n20:16 potential value of it but going back to\\n20:18 your question so like how do these\\n20:20 skills intertwine with successful\\n20:22 machine learning or you know the rules\\n20:24 of machine learning you have to\\n20:27 understand that like machine learning\\n20:28 you don't just get handed machine\\n20:29 learning projects and your only task is\\n20:31 to execute on it that does not happen a\\n20:33 huge part of a huge part of your role in\\n20:35 machine learning is to be able to\\n20:37 communicate back value to BU yourself\\n20:39 you know the the bandwidth and the\\n20:42 resources that you're going to need in\\n20:43 the future that's a very often\\n20:45 overlooked\\n20:47 aspect so you mentioned that uh these\\n20:50 machine learning projects are quite\\n20:52 complex and then they require 3x like\\n20:56 arbitrary number but they require a lot\\n20:57 more effort than a traditional usual\\n21:00 software engineering project not to\\n21:02 mention that these projects often fail\\n21:04 right because you don't know in advance\\n21:06 whether the project will succeed after\\n21:07 you put so much effort in them like how\\n21:09 do you sell that like uh by doing this\\n21:13 PC and showing it kind of sort of works\\n21:16 or yeah so there's a couple things going\\n21:19 for you with machine learning that you\\n21:20 can leverage to your benefit right now\\n21:23 it's actually this is the best time ever\\n21:25 for this because large language models\\n21:27 have generated excitement across the\\n21:28 entire planet so in this moment it is\\n21:31 much easier to sell people on machine\\n21:33 learning than it was four or five years\\n21:35 like there's this hype everywhere in\\n21:37 like open any website and you see gbt\\n21:39 llm\\n21:41 whatever it's a double-edged sword where\\n21:43 there's benefits that and negatives to\\n21:45 that however even so it is still\\n21:47 difficult to sell projects because like\\n21:49 you said th\", 'video_id': 'su2M058m3Lw'}, {'start': 31500, 'content': \" which is\\n28:30 like usually gradio or something like\\n28:31 that right yeah sometimes um a lot of\\n28:34 the times it depends depends of the\\n28:36 organization you know if I have more\\n28:37 time I'll do something like that\\n28:38 honestly sometimes I'll just go into\\n28:40 Google Sheets and something that's very\\n28:44 uh very very basic I see I see yeah yeah\\n28:47 interesting well we still wanted to talk\\n28:49 about the rules of machine learning and\\n28:51 the written once and there is this\\n28:55 famous article from Google which is\\n28:57 called the rules of machine learning\\n29:00 right you probably know about that and I\\n29:01 remember like the rule number one is\\n29:04 don't be afraid to start without machine\\n29:06 learning that's my favorite\\n29:08 one like and it's kind of funny because\\n29:11 like you're a data scientist or machine\\n29:12 learning engineer like how can you\\n29:14 advocate for not using machine learning\\n29:16 like it's a bit cond intuitive right and\\n29:18 then like the they talk about metrics\\n29:20 and so on so this is definitely a really\\n29:23 good article to talk about but since\\n29:26 today we talk about about the written\\n29:28 rules so I'm wondering what these rules\\n29:32 are yeah awesome question there's a lot\\n29:34 of them\\n29:36 so I I think actually let me touch on\\n29:39 what you just mentioned really quick\\n29:41 because I think it's so like regardless\\n29:42 of if it's written or not written I\\n29:44 think it's maybe let me expand on that\\n29:47 because of the importance of that which\\n29:48 is which is often not written so I\\n29:51 completely agree with that statement\\n29:53 that it is critical to and I I would\\n29:56 even go beyond saying don't be afraid to\\n29:58 start and I would say always try to\\n30:00 start without machine learning and the\\n30:02 reason for that is because the most\\n30:05 often the most frequent reason that I\\n30:07 see machine learning projects fail is\\n30:09 because whatever you end up building\\n30:12 doesn't naturally solve any problems so\\n30:14 even if you build an accurate machine\\n30:15 learning model that that does not\\n30:18 necessarily mean that whatever it's\\n30:20 doing is going to provide value to the\\n30:22 business and so ensuring that you are\\n30:26 before you build machine learning\\n30:28 ensuring that whatever problem you're\\n30:29 solving is actually worth solving with\\n30:33 or without machine learning that is that\\n30:35 should always be the first Focus so you\\n30:38 know I always emphasize you should do a\\n30:40 proof of concept herotic like rule-based\\n30:42 model first forget machine learning\\n30:44 forget all the complexities with that TR\\n30:46 try to just spin up a a manual process\\n30:48 or a rule-based process that emulates\\n30:51 what a machine learning model is going\\n30:52 to do but does so at a at a much more\\n30:55 basic level and honestly nine times out\\n30:58 of 10 if if you can't make that work the\\n31:01 machine learning model is also not going\\n31:02 to work I about that yeah so like a few\\n31:06 years\\n3\", 'video_id': 'su2M058m3Lw'}, {'start': 7500, 'content': \"'t popular right so it\\n7:36 became\\n7:37 more popular like maybe six years ago\\n7:40 right seven years ago\\n7:41 when it kind of boomed but before that\\n7:43 uh\\n7:44 yeah yeah right yeah so maybe uh\\n7:48 i have a few questions about your career\\n7:51 but maybe let's keep them\\n7:52 till the end because i really want to\\n7:54 get into the main topic of\\n7:55 monetizing machine learning so your head\\n7:58 linkedin headline says i monetize\\n8:01 machine learnings my machine learning\\n8:02 and i remember when i connected to you\\n8:04 on linkedin the first thing i asked you\\n8:07 about was what does it mean so\\n8:10 what is that what do you mean by i\\n8:12 monetize machine learning\\n8:14 well companies have different levels of\\n8:17 maturity when it comes to machine\\n8:19 learning so obviously i'm talking about\\n8:21 this broad spectrum of companies who are\\n8:25 either at the very early stages they\\n8:26 have data scientists and they\\n8:28 might have some prototype type projects\\n8:31 that have gone through the pipeline\\n8:33 they're in production all the way out to\\n8:36 companies that have done\\n8:38 advanced machine learning that actually\\n8:39 have products that are based around\\n8:41 models and no matter where you are in\\n8:44 the spectrum\\n8:46 there's this one common theme it is\\n8:48 revenue\\n8:49 and so companies are starting to look at\\n8:52 machine learning and saying okay this is\\n8:54 really expensive this is more expensive\\n8:57 than we thought the early companies that\\n8:59 are still doing prototypes are looking\\n9:00 at it from\\n9:01 a staffing perspective these engineers\\n9:04 are extremely expensive\\n9:05 they're now telling me i have to have\\n9:06 all these other different types of\\n9:08 products\\n9:08 to support machine learning and then you\\n9:11 have very very mature companies\\n9:13 who are looking at the cost to maintain\\n9:15 and deploy\\n9:16 high-end models these very very complex\\n9:18 models they're looking at that cost\\n9:20 and saying you know this just gets more\\n9:22 and more and more expensive as it's in\\n9:24 production so we need revenue\\n9:26 and so from both ends of the spectrum\\n9:28 you have companies saying\\n9:29 we need to make more money off of\\n9:31 machine learning so that's the core\\n9:33 driver\\n9:33 for monetization and what monetization\\n9:37 is\\n9:37 is teaching companies number one how to\\n9:39 become more mature\\n9:41 when they look at machine learning but\\n9:42 number two is to create\\n9:44 a strategy to handle everything from\\n9:48 research and\\n9:50 understanding how much value you can get\\n9:51 from research because that's the most\\n9:53 valuable thing a company can be doing is\\n9:56 creating research\\n9:57 doing research and creating artifacts\\n9:58 from that research\\n10:00 and then using it for project after\\n10:02 project product after product\\n10:04 in many cases they're defining new\\n10:05 categories and\\n10:07 evolving the business model in\\n10:09 interesting ways\\n10:11 the more mature they get with research\\n10:12 and the more they understand how to\\n10:14 monetize \", 'video_id': 'xCjzA_8S4kI'}, {'start': 46500, 'content': \"ing into machine\\n42:59 learning but you need to talk to\\n43:01 somebody\\n43:01 so this is me talking for 100 minutes\\n43:05 about the career and what you should\\n43:07 expect and how you should approach it\\n43:09 and what books and what courses you\\n43:10 should take to to\\n43:12 to you know to make it into the industry\\n43:14 i'm actually working right now in\\n43:16 version two of the course which\\n43:17 you know i'm just gonna replace the\\n43:19 first one because since i built that\\n43:21 course i've learned so much\\n43:22 so i'm working on the second version to\\n43:24 replace the first one\\n43:26 uh just to make that advice a little bit\\n43:29 let's call it better\\n43:30 right yeah that's what it's about but\\n43:32 yeah i remember watching this course\\n43:34 and to me like what i felt after\\n43:37 watching it\\n43:38 is that you somehow got into my head\\n43:41 took all the thoughts i have about like\\n43:43 how engineers should\\n43:45 approach uh getting into machine\\n43:48 learning\\n43:48 and you put it out in such a concise\\n43:51 and motivating manner so this is\\n43:54 excellent i recommend everyone who is\\n43:56 who is interested in this to check this\\n43:58 course out\\n43:59 yeah i appreciate it we have quite a lot\\n44:02 of questions and\\n44:04 one thing we promised to get back to\\n44:07 is for those who are not necessarily\\n44:09 great at coding\\n44:10 how can we how can they improve this\\n44:13 because one of the things we mentioned\\n44:14 is that coding is very important and\\n44:16 many people who failed\\n44:18 machine learning course it was not\\n44:20 because of the lack of math skills they\\n44:22 had\\n44:22 but because of their coding skills so\\n44:25 how can people\\n44:26 uh improve their coding skills yeah so\\n44:28 that is great question so\\n44:30 there is definitely a path for you if\\n44:32 you don't know coding to get good at\\n44:33 machine learning itself and then pick up\\n44:35 coding as you go there is definitely a\\n44:37 path there\\n44:38 i do have less experience with that path\\n44:41 because i'm usually focused on people\\n44:43 that already know how to code\\n44:45 so it's obviously natural for me to\\n44:47 recommend people if you don't know how\\n44:48 to code\\n44:49 first get excited about building\\n44:51 solutions first get there so don't worry\\n44:53 about machine learning that will come at\\n44:55 the right time and right place\\n44:57 focused on building things with your\\n45:00 computer\\n45:00 right focused on building programs learn\\n45:03 python\\n45:04 learn how to solve different problems\\n45:06 and machine learning will be a nice\\n45:08 addition to that by the way this is just\\n45:10 what i recommend\\n45:10 it's not necessary to i know people that\\n45:14 started with machine learning and added\\n45:16 coding\\n45:17 later on there is definitely a way to\\n45:19 make it but i usually recommend people\\n45:20 to start with python focus\\n45:22 there and then come back into machine\\n45:24 learning yeah\\n45:27 yeah i my wife is doing a course now i\\n45:30 don't remember the name it's about\\n45:31 python\\n4\", 'video_id': 'xVYOdRrN7hw'}],

it seems like there is a lot of interest\\n5:51 in data engineering these days\\n5:53 and you're probably so since\\n5:56 you said that you work with hadoop i\\n5:59 think you're in this area for quite a\\n6:01 while\\n6:02 um so i think now these days there is a\\n6:05 lot of a lot more interest\\n6:07 than even a couple of years ago so\\n6:10 now i talk to some data scientists and\\n6:12 they\\n6:13 they say that they want to get into data\\n6:15 engineering they want to start building\\n6:17 data pipelines\\n6:18 not just learn to build data pipelines\\n6:20 but switch to data engineering entirely\\n6:23 yeah you have any ideas why it's\\n6:25 happening\\n6:26 um generally the the thing that\\n6:29 generally happens is\\n6:30 when you look back a few years and i've\\n6:32 i've saw this everywhere\\n6:34 people were starting with data science\\n6:36 they they got themselves\\n6:38 they hired data scientists they had some\\n6:40 data laying around\\n6:42 and they basically analyzed the data i\\n6:45 had a few\\n6:46 business ideas we could do this we could\\n6:48 do that and then\\n6:49 they got to the science data science\\n6:52 track and they solved the problems but\\n6:55 at some point\\n6:57 that's where we are getting more and\\n6:58 more and more is they people realize\\n7:01 okay\\n7:01 now i have this i have this analytics\\n7:04 methods i have i solved the problem but\\n7:06 now i need to automate it now i need to\\n7:08 build something around it\\n7:10 how to actually bring this into\\n7:13 production\\n7:13 and that's that's why we see a lot more\\n7:16 engineering\\n7:17 is people leave the stage of like a\\n7:20 proof of concept and they go\\n7:22 they get more into this stage of okay\\n7:24 now we need to build something we need\\n7:25 to make money or we want to make money\\n7:27 we want to build a platform\\n7:30 that's that's the what i currently see\\n7:33 so basically data science uh\\n7:36 becomes more mature and companies\\n7:39 realize that okay\\n7:41 it's not just a one-time thing where we\\n7:43 do something jupiter notebook and throw\\n7:45 it away\\n7:46 right we need to automate it we need to\\n7:48

plumbing and building pipelines\\n3:24 let's start with your background can you\\n3:26 tell us about your career journey so far\\n3:29 yeah sure yeah my name is andreas cut\\n3:33 i'm in i'm coming from germany and\\n3:36 i'm i've been basically within computer\\n3:40 science all my life i\\n3:41 always loved computers and i started\\n3:43 like many people playing or\\n3:45 playing on computer computer games and\\n3:47 then i got into actual computer science\\n3:49 and studied computer science\\n3:52 after that i made a quick detour towards\\n3:56 sap consulting but that doesn't that was\\n3:59 nothing that wasn't\\n4:00 my thing and i came back into the\\n4:03 uh the computer science realm where i\\n4:05 started as a\\n4:06 as a software engineer and\\n4:10 basically in a project where um\\n4:13 where it was about the inter the iot\\n4:17 but the industrial iot so we were\\n4:20 working on\\n4:21 getting machine data and analyzing\\n4:23 machine data\\n4:25 and so basically uh that's where i got\\n4:28 into the topic of um\\n4:32 where where does uh or how i got into\\n4:35 big data big data was a thing back then\\n4:38 and everybody was talking about\\n4:39 big data and we're doing big data but i\\n4:42 actually had the problem that there were\\n4:44 so much\\n4:45 data coming coming around or coming in\\n4:48 that we yeah that the the standard tools\\n4:51 didn't work anymore\\n4:53 so i need to find solutions different\\n4:57 solutions to actually\\n4:58 yeah work this out and back then i\\n5:01 started with hadoop so\\n5:03 uh hadoop was really the the thing back\\n5:06 then\\n5:07 and uh that really turned out really\\n5:10 good\\n5:11 and so that's how i got into into the\\n5:13 into the field back then\\n5:15 big data now now data engineering

{'start': 6000, 'content': \"u know other things like\\n6:08 within a team deciding for some approach\\n6:11 or sometimes conflict resolutions right\\n6:14 and one of the most important tasks for\\n6:16 data hinging manager or any engineering\\n6:18 manager should be prioritizing the task\\n6:21 right you have lot of things coming on\\n6:23 your way right from various stakeholders\\n6:26 so how you\\n6:27 prioritize that that's one of the key\\n6:30 responsibilities as well\\n6:32 so you work on a data platform some\\n6:35 internal data platform right and you\\n6:37 manage the engineers right\\n6:40 and because the the setup we have to\\n6:43 elix is we have engineering managers\\n6:47 and\\n6:48 people who report to the engineering\\n6:50 managers are back-end engineers\\n6:52 front-end engineers and data engineers\\n6:55 right so\\n6:57 we don't have a role that is called data\\n6:58 engineering manager and usually there is\\n7:01 just an engineering manager who manages\\n7:03 the engineers\\n7:05 and i'm wondering why do we have this um\\n7:08 maybe because we work in so-called\\n7:11 feature teams like a team that works on\\n7:13 a specific\\n7:15 part of a product and everyone works on\\n7:17 the same thing while in your case your\\n7:19 team takes care of the other platform so\\n7:21 everyone on your team is a data engineer\\n7:23 right\\n7:24 absolutely yeah\\n7:26 correct yeah\\n7:28 and i guess it's helpful for data\\n7:30 engineers to have a manager who is also\\n7:32 a data engineer or at least who can\\n7:34 relate to the problems they have because\\n7:36 this is how they can\\n7:38 think what is the best way for the\\n7:41 development for coaching right and if we\\n7:44 have just a usual\\n7:46 engineering manager they might not\\n7:48 know in a lot of details about you know\\n7:51 new data tools and so on right that's\\n7:53 where you come into play into picture\\n7:56 and then this is you if you give\\n7:58 suggestions to people you tell them what\\n8:00 is good to learn right\\n8:02 yeah i think you mentioned very valid\\n8:04 point right um this role when i talk to\\n8:07 other engineering managers i realized\\n8:08 that as a data engineering manager you\\n8:11 have to\\n8:12 be in line with some hands-on activities\\n8:15 as well so you should know what your\\n8:16 team is working upon at the code level\\n8:18 sometimes right\\n8:20 so that's that's how i spend my time\\n8:22 like i wear two heads here so 50 of the\\n8:25 time i am working as an individual\\n8:26 contributor as a data engineer in my\\n8:28 team and remaining fifty percent i am uh\\n8:31 managing the team right\\n8:33 so\\n8:33 as you mentioned it uh correctly because\\n8:35 uh sometimes when you when you have\\n8:38 technical brainstorming you know or\\n8:40 maybe defining road maps then your\\n8:42 technical skill sets really comes into\\n8:44 play\\n8:45 so a data engineering manager should\\n8:48 should definitely you know have some\\n8:50 hands on not only just managing people\\n8:54 how do you find time to actually do this\\n8:56 like how large is your team

your\\n2:24 background\\n2:25 can you tell us a bit about your career\\n2:26 journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part specifically\\n3:50 in the big data engineering team\\n3:53 yeah i've heard that in advertising\\n3:55 there are there is so much data\\n3:57 that this data engineering big data\\n4:00 engineering becomes really important\\n4:01 because\\n4:02 these companies every day gets get\\n4:04 terabytes of data and they need to\\n4:06 effectively\\n4:07 uh process this data right yeah\\n4:10 and also what kind of makes uh the\\n4:12 solution of creptify unique\\n4:14 is data insights which are obviously\\n4:17 delivered to the help of\\n4:19 big data engineering team by having\\n4:21 different\\n4:22 sources of data and ways to transform\\n4:24 this data and deliver it to the clients\\n4:27 so what do you do at work uh what do you\\n4:29 usually do\\n4:30 as a big data engineer so my main\\n4:33 responsibility is building data\\n4:35 pipelines uh usually it's etl format\\n4:37 extract transform load so kind of\\n4:39 reading the data from some source\\n4:42 building transformations s\", 'video_id': 'yg3d1lFd7Uo'},

model but i didn't\\n4:22 really understand what's going on which\\n4:23 is partially due to the fact that my\\n4:24 mathematics background isn't that strong\\n4:27 so i didn't never really got the theory\\n4:29 behind it\\n4:30 but also i realized i kind of miss more\\n4:32 the engineering parts of it and\\n4:34 that was also the time when data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data scientists but also\\n4:40 people that actually before come before\\n4:42 them and\\n4:43 make data available for data science\\n4:45 because that's at the time was a common\\n4:47 frustration for data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native instruments to be\\n4:58 one of their first data engineers\\n5:01 i did that for a while um i still had\\n5:04 the ambition back then to transition\\n5:05 back into data science but i left native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and i realized eventually that this was\\n5:28 kind of a dead end for me\\n5:30 and so i\\n5:32 i remembered my software engineering\\n5:34 background which i actually enjoyed\\n5:36 except it was a repetitive and then\\n5:38 at the time i was speaking to somebody\\n5:40 at thoughtworks she was the first data\\n5:42 scientist at the thoughtworks in germany\\n5:44 at the time and she told me that\\n5:46 thoughtworks was planning to expand its\\n5:48 data engineering offering and what i'd\\n5:49 be interested in\\n5:52 in becoming the solidworks germany's\\n5:54 first data engineer and help her expand\\n5:56 that offering and i thought it was\\n5:58 really exciting and\\n5:59 especially since southwark is a great\\n6:01 place for really learning good software\\n6:03 engineering practices which as a data\\n6:05 engineer is always frustrated as a data\\n6:07 scientist that always frustrated me that\\n6:09 the quality of the code and the\\n6:11 collaboration wasn't as good as i was i\\n6:13 remembered it from my back in\\n6:14 engineering days\\n6:16 and so i jumped on that and that's when\\n6:17 i finally decided to stay in data\\n6:19 engineering which i had done on and off\\n6:21 before\\n6:23 and then then yeah after that was i went\\n6:26 to where i'm now it was my transfers and\\n6:28 built up data engineering there which\\n6:29 way i'm now heading a team\\n6:32 that's quite a story and thanks for\\n6:33 sharing so uh what i also wanted to ask\\n6:36 you the next question i prepared is that\\n6:38 you were a data scientist and then you\\n6:40 switched to data engineering and i\\n6:41 wanted to ask why i think you partly\\n6:43 answered that so you said

data scientist you already needed to\\n9:46 do some things that data engineers would\\n9:48 do right so you mentioned that at\\n9:50 soundcloud so you not only did modeling\\n9:54 but also everything that it was before\\n9:55 modeling like building data pipelines\\n9:58 and after modeling i guess deploying the\\n10:00 model so how does it overlap with what\\n10:04 data engineers usually do what you did\\n10:05 as a data scientist yes there's a lot of\\n10:07 overlap and\\n10:09 so there as the data scientists usually\\n10:12 are often you you don't work with\\n10:14 perfectly clean and perfectly delivered\\n10:16 data you will still build up your own\\n10:18 pipelines to make the data accessible\\n10:20 and especially if you move into more\\n10:23 production level\\n10:25 and\\n10:26 i mean the\\n10:27 data size is a very loose title and what\\n10:29 you do under this role can be very\\n10:30 different but there's often a lot of\\n10:33 pipelining work that you do on yourself\\n10:35 and i think\\n10:36 it's a good thing that data scientists\\n10:38 do that and don't just rely on data\\n10:40 engineers to kind of do handhold them\\n10:42 through these steps\\n10:45 and so there's a lot of transferable\\n10:46 skills it also depends great and also\\n10:48 data engineering is a very broad topic\\n10:51 and i never did the more kafka real-time\\n10:53 data engineering kind of stuff i've\\n10:54 carefully navigated myself around that\\n10:57 i've always done more what is now\\n10:58 considered analytics engineering maybe\\n11:01 which is more like the preparing data\\n11:03 for vi and data warehouses and\\n11:06 scheduling batch processing and all\\n11:08 these kind of things\\n11:10 so that was more my realm of data\\n11:12 engineering\\n11:13 and there's there's a this whole other\\n11:15 universe of data engineering that i've\\n11:16 never really touched and that i don't\\n11:18 feel i think where you need a better\\n11:20 understanding of distributed system and\\n11:21 things like that which i don't have\\n11:23 and so that is that's often more the\\n11:25 playground for people with a really\\n11:27 strong distributed computer

branch of data\\n11:38 engineering i think data scientists are\\n11:40 very well prepared there's obviously\\n11:42 things we need to learn but it there's a\\n11:44 lot\\n11:45 i've seen of i've often found that\\n11:47 people that come from peers of\\n11:49 engineering don't have a feeling for\\n11:50 data that they struggle more to move\\n11:52 into that space than people that come\\n11:54 that

had also like something geospatial\\n37:00 right and when you were looking for your\\n37:04 first freelance\\n37:06 job uh actually the the company you\\n37:09 ended up working for needed the

next\\n37:22 fre L will be exactly like like the\\n37:25 scenario but I think that's a a really\\n37:27 good good story like you learn a skill\\n37:30 in a project hands on and I mean forena\\n37:34 there's no expectation that you would\\n37:36 work 20 hours or 15 hours it's really\\n37:38 like if you have five hours in a week\\n37:41 just like a half a day or after work for\\n37:43 two or to three days you just join a\\n37:47 project and you work with other people\\n37:48 to try to come up with a solution it's a\\n37:51 very I think it's a cool way to learn\\n37:53 new skills and a lot less overwhelming\\n37:55 if you do like with a team mhm would you\\n37:59 say that uh it typically happens that\\n38:01 the skills you pick up uh on such\\n38:03 projects they are handon Hands-On skills\\n38:06 that translate to job skills I think so\\n38:10 first I\\n38:11 think I think everybody gives the same\\n38:13 advice when it comes to data science\\n38:14 like build your portfolio do this do do\\n38:17 that there are so many ways of doing\\n38:19 that right exactly there are a lot of\\n38:21 different ways of doing that but like as\\n38:23 I grow in my here I realize that people\\n38:26 are also looking for soft skills right\\n38:28 when they hire you they just don't want\\n38:30 to somebody who's great at their job but\\n38:33 cannot work with anybody else and I\\n38:35 think when you do projects like this you\\n38:37 are forced to pick up soft skills\\n38:39 because if you have 80 people working on\\n38:42 the same project you have to communicate\\n38:44 well you have to be able to follow up\\n38:46 what's going on you have to be able to\\n38:50 access resources and figure things on\\n38:52 your own to not be overwhelmed when you\\n38:55 open Slack and there are 30 messages on\\n38:58 one single Channel and you don't know\\n38:59 where to look for I think those it's\\n39:02 also a great place to develop those\\n39:03 skills because a lot of I think a lot of\\n39:06 engineering and data science also the\\n39:08 mindset that you applied to what you're\\n39:11 doing and the like if you were alone\\n39:14 you're working alone I'm sure that you\\n39:15 are developing very hard skills and very\\n39:17 technical skills but then maybe you\\n39:19 missing out on developing a little a\\n39:21 little bit more of the mindset and also\\n39:23

inside just\\n45:39 from multiple people having multiple\\n45:41 tables and\\n45:42 no one knows what's in there\\n45:46 i assume that data scientists\\n45:49 also they produce a lot of data so their\\n45:52 models produce data\\n45:53 they also need to document the data\\n45:55 right do they use the same tool for that\\n45:58 yeah they just use the same time\\n46:01 description\\n46:02 or

base\\n46:14 okay cool thanks uh we have a question\\n46:18 from ak\\n46:19 shot is\\n46:22 i think\\n46:26 so how much of data engineering should\\n46:27 one ideally know\\n46:29 i think we covered that um\\n46:32 a bit but um yeah so we talked about\\n46:36 that like how much data engineering\\n46:38 skills data scientists need to know\\n46:40 ideally um\\n46:43 but yeah we were more talking about like\\n46:45 if data scientists want to transition\\n46:47 into data engineering\\n46:48 but to be able to successfully do work\\n46:51 as data scientists\\n46:53 what kind of data engineering skills\\n46:55 they should have\\n46:58 i would say that coding skills it's also\\n47:00 important because i know that some\\n47:02 data scientists somewhere on the\\n47:03 mathematical side and they\\n47:05 more interested in building algorithms\\n47:07 than to write code\\n47:08 and it actually influences the quality\\n47:10 of the creation\\n47:12 because they you can either build just\\n47:15 everything for example in one notebook\\n47:17 and it would be hard to deploy it in\\n47:19 some way or they would build the whole\\n47:21 solution this libraries and for example\\n47:24 classes in python\\n47:25 maybe object-oriented programming so it\\n47:28 would be more like software engineering\\n47:30 way to do things\\n47:31 and the databases for sure as well\\n47:34 because they do need to read the data\\n47:36 or write some results there right\\n47:39 okay so basically uh improve your\\n47:41 software engineering skills\\n47:43 yeah yeah i think the trend i see\\n47:47 is now most data scientists in most\\n47:50 companies that\\n47:52 i see there is a requirement of being a\\n47:54 good\\n47:55 developer so maybe they don't need to be\\n47:58 as good as software

this work\\n26:34 even before they take courses right yeah\\n26:36 yeah exactly then you have more Focus\\n26:39 from the very beginning and you know\\n26:40 okay I want to focus on data engineering\\n26:42 so I take data\\n26:44 engineering and then uh yeah just after\\n26:48 the course perhaps instead of taking the\\n26:49 other courses focus on developing the\\n26:52 skills in this area focus on doing more\\n26:54 projects in this area exactly and then\\n26:57 get interviews in that area right and\\n27:00 try to understand where you stand what\\n27:02 else is needed required to get a job\\n27:05 hopefully after finishing our course you\\n27:07 get all the skills right yeah yeah but\\n27:10 sometimes some companies might require\\n27:13 something specific right that we don't\\n27:15 cover and then this is where you can\\n27:18 understand that okay yeah and then try\\n27:20 to focus on I know building a project\\n27:23 with this particular skill yeah it's\\n27:25 it's important to not get lost in doing\\n27:28 all the courses I don't know if if\\n27:29 really all of them do all uh all the\\n27:32 courses before starting a new course\\n27:34 just take some time and okay maybe have\\n27:37 a project even if so I finish data\\n27:40 engineering I do a project I do a a\\n27:43 project and I see if I enjoy doing it\\n27:46 okay I I suppose the hypothesis is\\n27:49 something that I would like but okay I\\n27:51 finish data engineering let me practice\\n27:54 let me show that I developed skills in\\n27:57 data\\n27:59 engineering and then think about another\\n28:02 course but going from uh one course to\\n28:06 another\\n28:07 is like I don't know the wor but yeah\\n28:11 it's better to avoid it like especially\\n28:14 like that's circle like you get on the\\n28:16 train of course after course after\\n28:19 course because I feel like I still don't\\n28:20 have enough qualifications but remember\\n28:24 you have also skills you have strs you\\n28:27 have experience\\n28:29 so don't forget about\\n28:32 that and when it comes to having even\\n28:35 more Focus cuz like okay we you\\n28:38 mentioned that when it comes to data\\n28:40 science it's such a broad topic it can\\n28:43 mean anything from analysts to hardcore\\n28:47 deep learning whatever right\\n28:50 um and when you read one job description\\n28:54 for data scientist it can be super\\n28:56 different from another description of\\n28:58 data scientist and the same thing with\\n29:00 data Engineers so you can be a data\\n29:01 engineer that builds a data platform you\\n29:04 can be a data engineer that helps\\n29:06 analyst you can be a data engineer that\\n29:08 works with data scientists right so\\n29:10 there are also\\n29:14 speci and like do if I already know okay\\n29:18 I want to do data science or I want to\\n29:19 do data engineering do I already should\\n29:23 I already have even more focus and think\\n29:26 okay like I want to focus on

scientists so there there is a bunch of\\n40:11 title but it really depends and maybe\\n40:13 the person could clarify a bit\\n40:15 it really depends on what you're doing\\n40:18 as in this intersection\\n40:21 i think\\n40:22 as a data scientist you at least i i\\n40:25 needed to do a lot of data engineering\\n40:27 because\\n40:28 now the data is not just the magically a\\n40:30 cc file that you can use that is clean\\n40:33 you need to\\n40:34 do a lot of work before you can put this\\n40:37 into a machine learning model and train\\n40:39 your model and\\n40:41 for me i\\n40:43 even needed to set up\\n40:45 like a workflow scheduler and to do all\\n40:48 that\\n40:49 i think in startups it's pretty common\\n40:51 that they hire a data scientist and then\\n40:54 it turns out that this data scientist\\n40:56 actually needs to do data engineering\\n40:57 work before they can start with\\n41:00 data science\\n41:01 yeah i i also saw a title in linkedin\\n41:04 some people put this title with the\\n41:07 title is data science engineer i don't\\n41:09 know how common it is and if it's a\\n41:12 thing or they just decided to you know\\n41:15 because this is how they felt\\n41:17 and they put it there i don't think it's\\n41:20 a common thing right\\n41:23 like data science engineer\\n41:25 i've seen that too but yeah also i\\n41:27 haven't seen it in job description i've\\n41:28 only seen it in people's profiles yeah\\n41:31 so probably people who ended up doing\\n41:34 data stuff even though they were hired\\n41:36 as data scientists yeah that's probably\\n41:42 okay and\\n41:43 so chetna is asking if\\n41:45 you have any tips for people who do not\\n41:48 have development experience how can they\\n41:51 transition to\\n41:52 data engineering i think we talked about\\n41:54 that already like picking up all these\\n41:56 skills\\n41:59 like general engineering skills i think\\n42:02 it was uh\\n42:03 build tools testings icd git

recommend\\n42:18 just doing toy projects on the side so\\n42:20 that's very common for software\\n42:22 engineers to do that they just build\\n42:23 something random that they just think is\\n42:26 fun or useful or\\n42:27 and do it with\\n42:29 do it find some friends to do it\\n42:30 together with because that makes a big\\n42:32 difference if you're not just working by\\n42:33 yourself but if

career\\n2:26 journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in

it\\n4:39 was one\\n4:40 month ago i was checking my twitter and\\n4:43 i saw your\\n4:44 thread on twitter and after reading this\\n4:47 thread\\n4:48 i decided to contact you\\n4:51 and it got my attention it was really\\n4:54 interesting so the threat was\\n4:55 about 12 career hacks\\n4:59 so can you tell us about this threat so\\n5:02 what are these\\n5:03 career hacks yeah so basically on the\\n5:06 twitter i was\\n5:07 talking about career change because it's\\n5:09 very popular topic\\n5:11 uh you know everybody actually changes\\n5:14 career\\n5:15 at least couple of times in their\\n5:16 lifetime but the first time is always\\n5:19 tricky so people always worry like oh\\n5:21 career change\\n5:22 and they always ask questions on how to\\n5:24 do it and how to approach\\n5:26 that challenge and i was uh feeling the\\n5:29 twitter\\n5:29 uh with useful hacks that i learned\\n5:32 during my career change\\n5:34 i learned it hard way so i decided maybe\\n5:36 i better share my\\n5:38 experience so people can uh hopefully\\n5:41 speed up the process a bit uh using my\\n5:44 advices if they find it useful\\n5:46 so the first career hack and one of the\\n5:49 most important ones\\n5:51 is to change your social circle to be\\n5:53 careful about your social circle\\n5:55 so basically if you have you know\\n5:59 great friends from childhood and parents\\n6:01 obviously you don't change them but you\\n6:02 have a lot of\\n6:03 colleagues and you have a lot of shallow\\n6:06 uh acquaintance not really difference in\\n6:09 your\\n6:10 network and if they are not helping you\\n6:12 in in your career change if they keep\\n6:14 telling you\\n6:14 that you're gonna fail it's a bad idea\\n6:17 you have a good job while you're\\n6:19 changing your career\\n6:20 changing career and maternity leave that\\n6:22 does not work nobody does it you know\\n6:25 in this case this uh circle doesn't\\n6:28 really help you and\\n6:30 it's important to cut off such social\\n6:32 interactions\\n6:34 and then you will have a space for new\\n6:36 people to come into your life because\\n6:37 you will have more free time than\\n6:39 and uh then you can be people\\n6:43 that are more supportive and that\\n6:45 already changed career and that can help\\n6:47 you and guide you through that\\n6:49 so that's essentially what i did i cut\\n6:51 off about like 70 percent of my\\n6:53 communications with\\n6:54 ex-colleagues and all those pessimistic\\n6:57 people who are telling me that\\n6:58 i will fail and change inquiry is a bad\\n7:00 idea

found\\n7:16 my new network in a career and not only\\n7:19 career now i also\\n7:20 have friends there and that was very\\n7:23 supportive because\\n7:25 there is a saying that uh your average\\n7:28

data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data scientists but also\\n4:40 people that actually before come before\\n4:42 them and\\n4:43 make data available for data science\\n4:45 because that's at the time was a common\\n4:47 frustration for data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native instruments to be\\n4:58 one of their first data engineers\\n5:01 i did that for a while um i still had\\n5:04 the ambition back then to transition\\n5:05 back into data science but i left native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and i realized eventually that this was\\n5:28 kind of a dead end for me\\n5:30 and so i\\n5:32 i remembered my software engineering\\n5:34 background which i actually enjoyed\\n5:36 except it was a repetitive and then\\n5:38 at the time i was speaking to somebody\\n5:40 at thoughtworks she was the first data\\n5:42 scientist at the thoughtworks in germany\\n5:44 at the time and she told me that\\n5:46 thoughtworks was planning to expand its\\n5:48 data engineering offering and what i'd\\n5:49 be interested in\\n5:52 in becoming the solidworks germany's\\n5:54 first data engineer and help her expand\\n5:56 that offering and i thought it was\\n5:58 really exciting and\\n5:59 especially since southwark is a great\\n6:01 place for really learning good software\\n6:03 engineering practices which as a data\\n6:05 engineer is always frustrated as a data\\n6:07 scientist that always frustrated me that\\n6:09 the quality of the code and the\\n6:11 collaboration wasn't as good as i was i\\n6:13 remembered it from my back in\\n6:14 engineering days\\n6:16 and so i jumped on that and that's when\\n6:17 i finally decided to stay in data\\n6:19 engineering which i had done on and off\\n6:21 before\\n6:23 and then then yeah after that was i went\\n6:26 to where i'm now it was my transfers and\\n6:28 built up data engineering there which\\n6:29 way i'm now heading a team\\n6:32 that's quite a story and thanks for\\n6:33 sharing so uh what i also wanted to ask\\n6:36 you

nothing to do\\n8:18 with reality\\n8:19 so some people contact me and ask me\\n8:22 questions like\\n8:23 i am 26 am i too old to change career\\n8:27 and i'm like seriously you're 26 you're\\n8:30

alexi\\n2:00 for inviting\\n2:02 uh yeah i started uh my career in\\n2:05 somewhere in 2010\\n2:07 like 12 years back and started as a\\n2:10 traditional etl developer and working\\n2:12 with the databases\\n2:14 and relational databases like sql server\\n2:17 oracle etl tools like ssis sssrs like\\n2:21 microstick\\n2:22 and then slowly moved into uh more of a\\n2:25 master data management kind of stuff for\\n2:27 enterprise\\n2:28 right and then somewhere in 2015 uh\\n2:32 started getting into cloud\\n2:34 and you know the volume of data was\\n2:36 increasing so\\n2:38 got some skill set dealing with uh big\\n2:40 data\\n2:41 right and\\n2:44 that got me into more of a data\\n2:45 engineering role\\n2:47 so transition from traditional uh etl\\n2:50 developer or bi developer you can call\\n2:52 it to more of a data engineering role\\n2:54 and nowadays dealing with\\n2:56 a lot of batch data and you know real\\n2:58 time streaming data building pipelines\\n3:01 exposing data to consumers like\\n3:04 to downstream systems\\n3:06 so yeah that's it's been a very\\n3:09 interesting journey in last 12 years and\\n3:11 currently in\\n3:13 since last two and a half to three years\\n3:15 took up uh this data engineering manager\\n3:18 role where i am managing a team of\\n3:20 enthusiast data engineers here in india\\n3:23 and\\n3:24 yeah building iot data platform for\\n3:28 one of the siemens businesses\\n3:32 that's that's pretty cool a pretty cool\\n3:34 journey so your journey into what we\\n3:37 call today data engineering started with\\n3:39 cloud adoption right so you saw that\\n3:41 many companies started to use cloud and\\n3:43 this is so when you turned\\n3:45 your transition from etl developer to a\\n3:48 data engineer right\\n3:50 do you think it's different or just the\\n3:52 same thing but under a different name\\n3:55 no it's absolutely same\\n3:58 i mean\\n3:59 basics remain same but right but you\\n4:02 have to acquire a new skill set but when\\n4:04 this data paradigm is shifting right\\n4:06 so a lot of things changes when the\\n4:08 volume and variety of data grows right\\n4:11 so in traditional ways days we were\\n4:13 dealing more likely with the structured\\n4:15 data which is more in relation in nature\\n4:18 but these days with evolution of uh you\\n4:20 know machines and sensors right social\\n4:23 media a lot of unstructured and\\n4:25 semi-structured data use case we are\\n4:27 dealing with\\n4:29 so before you probably use tools like\\n4:31 informatica talent\\n4:34 microsoft integration

you\\n19:57 will find in a platform will look mostly\\n19:59 the same into another cloud provider\\n20:02 don't focus on\\n20:05 I would say Do not focus on getting\\n20:07 certifications to prove

key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part

update a little bit the\\n13:39 curriculum to make it a bit more modern\\n13:42 and that's all I got to work together\\n13:44 with Daniel on this and then um I got\\n13:47 inspired that maybe we should have some\\n13:49 Google certification or Cloud\\n13:51 certifications if we work in bigquery\\n13:53 and do anything data related we might as\\n13:56 well get some certifications for

miss more\\n4:32 the engineering parts of it and\\n4:34 that was also the time when data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data

data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native instruments to be\\n4:58 one of their first data engineers\\n5:01 i did that for a while um i still had\\n5:04 the ambition back then to transition\\n5:05 back into data science but i left native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and

interviewing Financial techies so\\n15:04 managers of data in fintech companies or\\n15:09 in fintech departments or in fraud\\n15:11 departments what kind of methodologies\\n15:13 they have implemented in their\\n15:16 um in their teams and if this is an\\n15:20 exhaustive list and I came up with the\\n15:21 list like money laundering identity\\n15:23 theft so on identity management and so\\n15:27 on and so forth then I audited some\\n15:30 Coursera classes and see what is the\\n15:32 fraud class because there are classes on\\n15:34 fraud massive massive classes like it\\n15:38 could be a semester but just to glean a\\n15:40 couple of Concepts from them\\n15:43 um so as I said the specifically\\n15:45 curriculum was fintech and after getting\\n15:48 the the high level topics uh we decided\\n15:52 to spend maybe a couple of days on each\\n15:54 topic find the data sets that would\\n15:56 support it\\n15:58 um think of complexity trying ourselves\\n16:00 to actually recode with the problems\\n16:03 ourselves before uh before\\n16:07 putting out the curriculum because what\\n16:09 if it's too hard right I need to like as\\n16:12 a manager I need to understand the\\n16:13

career\\n2:26 journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part specifically\\n3:50 in the big data engineering team\\n3:53 yeah i've heard that in advertising\\n3:55 there are there is so much data\\n3:57 that this data engineering big data\\n4:00 engineering becomes really important\\n4:01 because\\n4:02 these companies every day gets get\\n4:04 terabytes of data and they need to\\n4:06 effectively\\n4:07 uh process this data right yeah\\n4:10 and also what kind of makes uh the\\n4:12 solution of creptify unique\\n4:14 is data insights which are obviously\\n4:17 delivered to the help of\\n4:19 big data engineering team by having\\n4:21 different\\n4:22 sources of data and ways to transform\\n4:24 this data and deliver it to the clients\\n4:27 so what do you do at work uh what do you\\n4:29 usually do\\n4:30 as a big data engineer so my main\\n4:33 responsibility is building data\\n4:35 pipelines uh usually it's etl

product analytics tools you can do that\\n38:17 um\\n38:18 using this this third party too so yeah\\n38:21 a lot of different tools solving\\n38:23 different\\n38:24 pieces of the puzzle uh of course like\\n38:26 to implement all of these different\\n38:27 tools you'd\\n38:28 uh need like a lot of resources you'd\\n38:30 need a data team\\n38:32 um at least a couple of or maybe at\\n38:34 least one dedicated data engineer\\n38:36 so it's not possible for early stage\\n38:38 startups to do everything\\n38:40 um and that's where it's also worth\\n38:43 mentioning\\n38:44 cdp's customer data platforms which are\\n38:47 sort of they're like an all-in-one\\n38:49 bundled solution\\n38:50 where you can track data and then you\\n38:52 can send data to different tools\\n38:54 um so you can like you can create\\n38:56 audiences and create your\\n38:57 models and segments inside a cdp of\\n39:00 course\\n39:01 it has limited capabilities you can't\\n39:03 exactly do everything you can do

teams so yeah\\n39:16 i was trying to take a note of all the\\n39:20 tools you mentioned but there are simply\\n39:21 so many\\n39:23 and i'm wondering so let's say i just\\n39:25 started the startup\\n39:27 i and my co-founder so i haven't started\\n39:30 the startup i'm just like a hypothetical\\n39:31 hypothetical yeah\\n39:32 yes so i have a co-founder so there are\\n39:35 two of us we just started the startup\\n39:37 and to understand that data is important\\n39:40 we want to collect and we look at all\\n39:42 these tools and\\n39:43 there are just too many like how do we\\n39:45 make a decision which tool to choose\\n39:47 like\\n39:48 uh i think it's not about are they\\n39:51 different\\n39:51 similar yeah how to choose yeah i think\\n39:54 i think it's first important to define\\n39:56 what your\\n39:56 goals are uh and a good way to think\\n39:59 about this is to like just\\n40:00 list down uh you know 10 questions that\\n40:02 you want to answer with data\\n40:04 and then work backwards and and figure\\n40:06 out the tools uh\\n40:08 of course there are ready-made tools but\\n40:09 a lot of companies end up\\n40:11 uh you know fixing these problems or\\n40:14 implementing these solutions without uh\\n40:16 buying ready-made tools by building in\\n40:18 our schools so\\n40:19 it depends uh you know what your\\n40:20 resources are because\\n40:22 these tools can also get expensive but\\n40:24 uh at the very least you need\\n40:26 you need to start collecting data so you\\n40:29 need uh tool\\n40:30 like a cdi to like segment connections\\n40:32 broader stack\\n40:33 uh meta router uh i'll share this whole\\n40:36 list\\n40:37 which actually written a lot about this\\n40:38 stuff so shares list\\n40:40 um and once you have the \", 'video_id':

and moving towards more open source\\n4:50 frameworks right\\n4:52 okay yeah thanks\\n4:54 so let's talk about data engineering\\n4:56 managers so what do they do and why do\\n4:59 we need them\\n5:01 yeah so um\\n5:04 actually the core uh still remains same\\n5:07 as a people manager right so we have to\\n5:09 take care of your team you know you have\\n5:10 to\\n5:11 you know keep looking at you know how\\n5:13 your team is moving your deliverables\\n5:15 etc\\n5:16 but uh another thing which you know adds\\n5:18 up to this role is stakeholder\\n5:20 management right when you're working\\n5:22 with as an individual contributor you're\\n5:24 just\\n5:25 caring about your piece of work here you\\n5:28 have to talk to various stakeholders who\\n5:30 are sponsoring this data platform as\\n5:32 well as\\n5:33 who are consumers right these days the\\n5:36 the number of and variety of consumers\\n5:38 are also growing\\n5:39 they are the stakeholders for us right\\n5:41 so as a data engineering manager you\\n5:43 have to take care of them\\n5:44 their needs right\\n5:46 and uh again uh from the team\\n5:49 your team is also your stakeholder right\\n5:50 so you have to make sure you know their\\n5:53 skill set are getting upgraded\\n5:55 along with the\\n5:57 new tools and technologies coming into\\n5:59 play right\\n6:00 and then\\n6:01 coaching them just deciding their career\\n6:03 path right\\n6:05 and sometimes you know other things like\\n6:08 within a team deciding for some approach\\n6:11 or sometimes conflict resolutions right\\n6:14 and one of the most important tasks for\\n6:16 data hinging manager or any engineering\\n6:18 manager should be prioritizing the task\\n6:21 right you have lot of things coming on\\n6:23 your way right from various stakeholders\\n6:26 so how you\\n6:27 prioritize that that's one of the key\\n6:30 responsibilities as well\\n6:32 so you work on a data platform some\\n6:35 internal data platform right and you\\n6:37 manage the engineers right\\n6:40 and because the the setup we have to\\n6:43 elix is we have engineering managers\\n6:47 and\\n6:48 people who report to the engineering\\n6:50 managers are back-end engineers\\n6:52 front-end engineers and data engineers\\n6:55 right so\\n6:57 we don't have a role that is called data\\n6:58 engineering manager and usually there is\\n7:01 just an engineering manager who manages\\n7:03 the engineers\\n7:05 and i'm wondering why do we have this um\\n7:08 maybe because we work in so-called\\n7:11 feature teams like a team that works on\\n7:13 a specific\\n7:15 part of a product and everyone works on\\n7:17 the same thing while in your case your\\n7:19 team takes care of the other platform so\\n7:21 everyone on your team is a data engineer\\n7:23 right\\n7:24 absolutely yeah\\n7:26 correct yeah\\n7:28 and i guess it's helpful for data\\n7:30 engineers to have a manager who is also\\n7:32 a data engineer or at least who can\\n7:34 relate to the problems they have because\\n7:36 this is how the\", 'video_id': 'FljnbUQ796w'}, {'start': 4500, 'content': \"alized\\n4:14 i didn't really enjoy data science as\\n4:16 much

databases like sql server\\n2:17 oracle etl tools like ssis sssrs like\\n2:21 microstick\\n2:22 and then slowly moved into uh more of a\\n2:25 master data management kind of stuff for\\n2:27 enterprise\\n2:28 right and then somewhere in 2015 uh\\n2:32 started getting into cloud\\n2:34 and you know the volume of data was\\n2:36 increasing so\\n2:38 got some skill set dealing with uh big\\n2:40 data\\n2:41 right and\\n2:44 that got me into more of a data\\n2:45 engineering role\\n2:47 so transition from traditional uh etl\\n2:50 developer or bi developer you can call\\n2:52 it to more of a data engineering role\\n2:54 and nowadays dealing with\\n2:56 a lot of batch data and you know real\\n2:58 time streaming data building pipelines\\n3:01 exposing data to consumers like\\n3:04 to downstream systems\\n3:06 so yeah that's it's been a very\\n3:09 interesting journey in last 12 years and\\n3:11 currently in\\n3:13 since last two and a half to three years\\n3:15 took up uh this data engineering manager\\n3:18 role where i am managing a team of\\n3:20 enthusiast data engineers here in india\\n3:23 and\\n3:24 yeah building iot data platform for\\n3:28 one of the siemens businesses\\n3:32 that's that's pretty cool a pretty cool\\n3:34 journey so your journey into what we\\n3:37 call today data engineering started with\\n3:39 cloud adoption right so you saw that\\n3:41 many companies started to use cloud and\\n3:43 this is so when you turned\\n3:45 your transition from etl developer to a\\n3:48 data engineer right\\n3:50 do you think it's different or just the\\n3:52 same thing but under a different name\\n3:55 no it's absolutely same\\n3:58 i mean\\n3:59 basics remain same but right but you\\n4:02 have to acquire a new skill set but when\\n4:04 this data paradigm is shifting right\\n4:06 so a lot of things changes when the\\n4:08 volume and variety of data grows right\\n4:11 so in traditional ways days we were\\n4:13 dealing more likely with

So what's the core difference\\n28:25 between all these uh people all these\\n28:28 roles?\\n28:28 That's a good question. Um and in\\n28:31 practice it depends again a lot on the\\n28:33 type of company you have the type of\\n28:35 product uh in some cases the product is\\n28:38 more technology related if you're\\n28:40 building you know a a framework or a\\n28:42 platform that other companies are going\\n28:44 to use uh versus building something that\\n28:47 end users etc. So it varies quite a bit\\n28:50 but I I would say the typically the\\n28:52 responsibilities are are different in\\n28:54 the sense that a CPO is more focused on\\n28:57 determining what is the product vision\\n28:59 right what is the product supposed to do\\n29:02 and then works with the CTO which is\\n29:04 focused on how do we build that and how\\n29:06 the product uh or how we use technology\\n29:09 to make that vision come to life and\\n29:11 then um the co is more concerned with\\n29:14 okay what data do we have that enables\\n29:16 us to build that to inform form the\\n29:18 direction that we're going in and to\\n29:21 continue pushing that that vision\\n29:22 forward. So that could be a high level\\n29:25 theoretical division of of\\n29:27 responsibilities.\\n29:28 But like I mentioned, I think it depends\\n29:30 a lot. I I've seen the case where you\\n29:32 know some companies their product is\\n29:34 data and there the CEO can likely uh\\n29:37 fulfill both roles. I've seen places\\n29:39 where all of those roles are combined.\\n29:42 uh and I've seen places where they're\\n29:43 very clear um differentiated because\\n29:46 that's the nature of the product and the\\n29:48 technology stack that they have as well\\n29:50 as the data they produce for consumers.\\n29:52 Mhm. So maybe to make it a bit concrete,\\n29:56 we talked about this example of I don't\\n29:58 know get X market share or like have\\n30:02 that amount of revenue. Probably this is\\n30:04 a goal that maybe a CEO would set\\n30:08 together with the entire team, right?\\n30:10 And then it would be up to the CTO, CPO,\\n30:14 CDO to actually decide how to decompose\\n30:17 this goal and what uh kind of data\\n30:20 initiatives uh could happen right so\\n30:23 like I don't know um we need to make\\n30:26 data available to make this this and\\n30:28 this available or possible right and so\\n30:31 basically everyone thinks in terms of uh\\n30:33 okay what we can do from the engineering\\n30:35 point of view like what we can do from\\n30:37 the product point of view what we can do\\n30:39 from the data point of view, right? And\\n30:41 then it kind of cascades down to uh\\n30:44 maybe later to PP of data, right? Who\\n30:47 would need to think about a particular\\n30:49 chunk of the um um I don't know the\\n30:54 strategy, right? And then up to uh I\\n30:57 don't know engineering managers and so\\n30:59 on, right?\\n31:00 Yeah. VP of data, whatever the titles\\n31:02 are in that organization, whatever the\\n31:05 design of the organization is.

I think again it\\n26:59 depends a lot on the organization right\\n27:01 if you have to spend a lot of time\\n27:02 thinking about you know what uh kinds of\\n27:05 data will we need in the future how do\\n27:07 we tie and we enable the business to\\n27:10 move in this direction how do we uh\\n27:12 report data in a way or how do you\\n27:14 comply with the governance models from a\\n27:17 specific region of the world etc um and\\n27:20 then you need to also at the same time\\n27:23 execute against building this tool\\n27:25 building this framework building this\\n27:27 infrastruure structure then the division\\n27:29 of of work can be fairly simple and\\n27:31 there's still a ton of of work to do um\\n27:34 that is covered by a co versus a VP but\\n27:37 like I mentioned I think that's entirely\\n27:38 dependent on the size of the\\n27:40 organization how the roles are defined\\n27:43 and this applies not just to to data\\n27:45 right it applies to CPO to VP of product\\n27:48 uh for technology as well as as well as\\n27:51 other functions so it just depends on\\n27:54 how much is there to do and how many\\n27:56 people do we need to do it successfully\\n27:58 and continue building upon that.\\n28:01 Do you know what's the the main\\n28:03 difference between CTO, CPU and CDO? Uh\\n28:07 like to me uh like when I look uh um\\n28:10 like in the like top management\\n28:14 it's all about meetings and setting\\n28:16 strategy and uh you know planning for\\n28:18 budgets.\\n28:19 This uh responsibilities look pretty\\n28:22 similar. So what's the core difference\\n28:25 between all these uh people all these\\n28:28 roles?\\n28:28 That's a good question. Um and in\\n28:31 practice it depends again a lot on the\\n28:33 type of company you have the type of\\n28:35 product uh in some cases the product is\\n28:38 more technology related if you're\\n28:40 building you know a a framework or a\\n28:42 platform that other companies are going\\n28:44 to use uh versus building something that\\n28:47 end users etc. So it varies quite a bit\\n28:50 but I I would say the typically the\\n28:52 responsibilities are are different in\\n28:54 the sense that a CPO is more focused on\\n28:57 determining what is the product vision\\n28:59 right what is the product supposed to do\\n29:02 and then works with the CTO which is\\n29:04 focused on how do we build that and how\\n29:06 the product uh or how we use technology\\n29:09 to make that vision come to life and\\n29:11 then um the co is more concerned with\\n29:14 okay what data do we have that enables\\n29:16 us to build that to inform form the\\n29:18 direction that we're going in and to\\n29:21 continue pushing that that vision\\n29:22 forward. So that could be a high level\\n29:25 theoretical division of of\\n29:27 responsibilities.\\n29:28 But like I mentioned, I think it depends\\n29:30 a lot. I I've seen the case where you\\n29:32 know some companies their product is\\n29:34 data and there the CEO can likely uh\\n29:37 fulfill both roles. I've seen places\\n29:39 where all of those roles are combined.\\n29:42 uh and \", 'video_id': 'IdaZOD46FEw'}, {'start': 45000, 'content': \" where based on the central\\n44:18 policies these columns are automatically\\n44:21 massed so a good example is like\\n44:23 marketing has a data sets customer data\\n44:26 they say based on their policy so John\\n44:29 and Mary can access this data set I\\n44:31 approve access but in that data set it's\\n44:34 like payment card information or home\\n44:36 address then there should be Central\\n44:37 policy that says like this comp should\\n44:40 always be missed and that's something\\n44:42 that should be automated as much as\\n44:44 possible we call we call this by the way\\n44:47 we call this the the Conway Benson\\n44:50 movement where both teams collaborate on\\n44:52 that topic great question\\n44:55 yeah another question from the same\\n44:56 person and we spoke already about this\\n45:00 role explosion that's when we have too\\n45:03 many roles maybe when we forget to\\n45:05 revoke access uh\\n45:07 and the question is do you have any\\n45:09 recommendations for following the least\\n45:11 privileged privileged access principles\\n45:13 without filing in failing into the role\\n45:17 explosion problem when there is a role\\n45:19 dedicated for each private data set\\n45:21 uh there's a role for each data set\\n45:24 right I see\\n45:26 um tough question so\\n45:29 um what I've seen is that role explosion\\n45:32 typically comes when your roles divert\\n45:35 from how the business uses\\n45:37 um data so a couple of things there is\\n45:41 like we we see work with organizations\\n45:44 that have like the wall inheritance they\\n45:46 have the data roles that give you low\\n45:48 level permissions on data sets reads\\n45:51 permissions write permissions and so\\n45:53 forth and then you have the functional\\n45:55 roles that correspond to your roles in\\n45:57 the business that you can then assume\\n45:59 the data roles right so that's one way\\n46:03 another reason for role explosion is\\n46:06 like the access requests right so people\\n46:08 request access for you know building an\\n46:11 ml model for investigating issues\\n46:13 there's no role that matches that\\n46:15 request perfectly so what you typically\\n46:17 do is then just create quickly new one\\n46:19 and then forget to revoke it so I think\\n46:21 like regular reviews and alerts for\\n46:24 unused rules will definitely help with\\n46:27 that so I think like having like the the\\n46:30 role inheritance where you have roles\\n46:32 that mention business and roles that\\n46:34 match the data combined with regular\\n46:36 reviews and alerts on unusuals I think\\n46:39 that should should help\\n46:42 thank you make sense and another\\n46:44 question is uh and I've been sort of\\n46:47 guilty of that too\\n46:48 oftentimes data owners do not know if\\n46:51 the data is sensitive or not and or\\n46:53 maybe they accidentally may make made a\\n46:55 mistake\\n46:56 so how to make sure that we have the\\n46:58 right process to catch\\n47:01 pii data personal identifiable\\n47:03

that's i mean you we joke about it\\n39:10 but i think that's that's absolutely\\n39:11 right um it's funny because there's\\n39:13 organizations that they don't even\\n39:15 really specify the roles that uh like\\n39:17 doordash apparently doesn't specify the\\n39:19 exact roles that each of their science\\n39:21 you know they don't like specifically\\n39:22 pigeonhole people into roles they

not sure if it's a good thing\\n19:17 or a bad thing maybe you can tell us but\\n19:20 I think one of the consequences of that\\n19:22 that you kind of lose focus right yeah\\n19:25 exactly so how in

what do you have as\\n20:47 strengths and what do you have as uh\\n20:50 qualifications of course qualifications\\n20:53 strengths skills and then what do you\\n20:55 have as experience so taking

instead of taking the\\n26:49 other courses focus on developing the\\n26:52 skills in this area focus on doing more\\n26:54 projects in this area exactly and then\\n26:57 get interviews in that area

Focus cuz like okay we you\\n28:38 mentioned that when it comes to data\\n28:40 science it's such a broad topic it can\\n28:43 mean anything from analysts to hardcore\\n28:47 deep learning whatever right\\n28:50 um and when you read one job description\\n28:54 for data scientist it can be super\\n28:56 different from another description of\\n28:58 data scientist and the same thing with\\n29:00 data Engineers so you can be a data\\n29:01 engineer that builds a data platform you\\n29:04 can be a data engineer that helps\\n29:06 analyst you can be a data engineer that\\n29:08 works with data scientists right so\\n29:10 there are also\\n29:14 speci and like do if I already know okay\\n29:18 I want to do data science or I want to\\n29:19 do data engineering do I already should\\n29:23 I already have even more focus and think\\n29:26 okay like I want to focus on this\\n29:28 particular type of data science job or\\n29:31 \", 'video_id': 'PchwbIs0tOg'}, {'start': 3000, 'content': \"2:49 conferences mostly in and around\\n2:51 Amsterdam with by data\\n2:54 so what did you do as a data science\\n2:56 indicator you said you your\\n2:59 responsibilities included creating\\n3:01 courses yes that's good yeah yeah so at\\n3:05 the code 80 Driven Academy we teach a\\n3:07 lot of courses on every thing data\\n3:09 science so some are very generic like an\\n3:11 introduction to python for data analysts\\n3:14 or an introduction to data science for\\n3:17 instance but we also create a lot of\\n3:20 courses very specifically targeted\\n3:21 towards a specific audience so for\\n3:23 instance I created a deep learning with\\n3:25 NLP course or a an unsupervised learning\\n3:28 course and those are more detailed or\\n3:30 more specific topics and then gave me an\\n3:32 opportunity to really dive into that\\n3:34 topic and create good exercises and\\n3:36 assignments and material on that that\\n3:38 was really fun yeah I think I spoke with\\n3:41 folks from your company from go data\\n3:43 driven at the restaurant by data by Con\\n3:46 in Berlin and as far as I remember\\n3:49 you're doing education and consultancy\\n3:52 right that's yeah\\n3:54 so I was mostly a data science educator\\n3:57 for about two years but I strongly\\n4:00 believe that you can't be a good teacher\\n4:02 if you don't also have hands-on\\n4:03 experience so I I like to really when I\\n4:06 do courses or when I teach courses\\n4:08 really tell a lot of anecdotes about my\\n4:11 experiences and in my work because it\\n4:14 speaks more to the imagination of why\\n4:15 we're doing this than just talking about\\n4:17 the concepts so while I really enjoyed\\n4:20 it I do feel like after two years mostly\\n4:22 focusing on the educational side I I\\n4:25 need some hands-on experience and also I\\n4:27 was really missing this decoding bit so\\n4:29 that's uh so so the ideal situation for\\n4:32 me is to do both trainings and education\\n4:34 and also work as a data scientist and\\n4:37 combine that in some way do you still\\n4:40 teach\\n4:42 uh occasionally some courses but I'm\\n4:44 more focused on my lead data science\\n4:46 role at the moment\\n4:47 what do you do as a lead data scientist\\n4:51 um I'm with a company where\\n4:53 um I'm mostly focused on building a\\n4:55 community of practice there they just\\n4:57 went through a transition in their the\\n4:59 way that they organize their teams and I\\n5:01 want to make sure that all the data\\n5:03 scientists still communicate clearly\\n5:05 with each other get to exchange\\n5:06 knowledge but also increase the maturity\\n5:09 level of the data science products that\\n5:10 we produce so make sure that we are not\\n5:13 just everyone doing something on their\\n5:15 own time behind their own laptop but\\n5:17 bringing them together make sure that we\\n5:18 actually get to mature well-functioning\\n5:21 monitored data science products\\n5:24 yeah this is such an interesting topic\\n5:25 but I'm afraid or I want to ask more\\n5:29 about that intent if we run out of\\n5:31 questions uh yeah because the the main\\n5:33 topic for today is actually data center\\n5\", 'video_id':

they can\\n24:52 have like an intersection in some points\\n24:55 but the focus the main focus would be\\n24:57 different from from data science data\\n24:59 engineer so I could I was getting lost\\n25:02 not getting any\\n25:05 um opportunities to have interviews uh\\n25:08 rejections what can I do and so on\\n25:12 until I narrow it down my focus and\\n25:15 that's when I started to become more\\n25:18 confident more ready for the interviews\\n25:20 I could have specific plan forar\\n25:23 learning and I started to get interviews\\n25:26 although I I narrow it down I was like\\n25:29 data scientist and I remember also ml\\n25:31 engineer I kept it as as a a data\\n25:35 scientist and ml engineer for me and\\n25:38 that was my\\n25:39 focus so yeah that's the focus doesn't\\n25:44 really um reduce your chances and yeah\\n25:48 and another thing I don't know another\\n25:51 thing is that companies want want some\\n25:54 people that have experience so if you\\n25:57 keep applying for all of\\n25:59 these courses at the end you are\\n26:01 applying for data engineer ml engineer\\n26:04 data scientist then the company who is\\n26:07 hiring for a data engineer which\\n26:10 requires more\\n26:11 infra infrastructure and tooling and\\n26:14 like preparation of the\\n26:16 data workflow and so on they will not\\n26:19 find you having that um practice of data\\n26:23 engine because you are trying to do all\\n26:24 of them yeah so which means that um\\n26:29 let's say somebody wants to take our\\n26:32 courses they should do some of this work\\n26:34 even before they take courses right yeah\\n26:36 yeah exactly then you have more Focus\\n26:39 from the very beginning and you know\\n26:40 okay I want to focus on data engineering\\n26:42 so I take data\\n26:44 engineering and then uh yeah just after\\n26:48 the course perhaps instead of taking the\\n26:49 other courses focus on developing the\\n26:52 skills in this area focus on doing more\\n26:54 projects in this area exactly and then\\n26:57 get interviews in that area right and\\n27:00 try to understand where you stand what\\n27:02 else is needed required to get a job\\n27:05 hopefully after finishing our course you\\n27:07 get all the skills right yeah yeah but\\n27:10 sometimes some companies might require\\n27:13 something specific right that we don't\\n27:15 cover and then this is where you can\\n27:18 understand that okay yeah and then try\\n27:20 to focus on I know building a project\\n27:23 with this particular skill yeah it's\\n27:25 it's important to not get lost in doing\\n27:28 all the courses I don't know if if\\n27:29 really all of them do all uh all the\\n27:32 courses before starting a new course\\n27:34 just take some time and okay maybe have\\n27:37 a project even if so I finish data\\n27:40 engineering I do a project I do a a\\n27:43 project and I see if I enjoy doing it\\n27:46 okay I I suppose the hypothesis

talk about\\n2:13 the role of a data engineer and data\\n2:14 scientist welcome\\n2:17 thank you before we go before we start\\n2:20 with our\\n2:21 main topic let's talk a bit about your\\n2:24 background\\n2:25 can you tell us a bit about your career\\n2:26 journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part specifically\\n3:50 in the big data engineering team\\n3:53 yeah i've heard that in advertising\\n3:55 there are there is so much data\\n3:57 that this data engineering big data\\n4:00 engineering becomes really important\\n4:01 because\\n4:02 these companies every day gets get\\n4:04 terabytes of data and they need to\\n4:06 effectively\\n4:07 uh process this data right yeah\\n4:10 and also what kind of makes uh the\\n4:12 solution of creptify unique\\n4:14 is data insights which are obviously\\n4:17 delivered to the help of\\n4:19 big data engineering team by having\\n4:21 different\\n4:22 sources of data and ways to transform\\n4:24 this data and deliver it to the clients\\n4:27 so what do you do at work uh what do you\\n4:29 usually do\\n4:30 as a big data engineer so my main\\n4:33 responsibility is building

some last\\n1:04:42 tips for preparing for interviews and\\n1:04:44 that we did not kind of car maybe people\\n1:04:46 will be interested\\n1:04:48 about those so to prepare for interviews\\n1:04:51 the best tip i can give is to actually\\n1:04:54 practice\\n1:04:55 it as a mock interview and the resource\\n1:04:57 that i mentioned is prompt\\n1:04:59 but the best resource is also your\\n1:05:02 network\\n1:05:03 so talk to people who also looking for a\\n1:05:06 job and\\n1:05:07 you kind of interview each other because\\n1:05:10 it's nice to see it from the other side\\n1:05:11 of the table as well\\n1:05:13 and another for russian speaking\\n1:05:16 communities we can send a link to some\\n1:05:18 telegram channels and the telegram\\n1:05:19 channels people also meet\\n1:05:21 to mock interview on system design\\n1:05:24 and on coding and machine learning\\n1:05:26 design that type of things\\n1:05:28 to prepare for interview you\\n1:05:31 when you think that you're gonna go for\\n1:05:34 interviews soon\\n1:05:34 it's time to start practicing lead code\\n1:05:37 because\\n1:05:38 they ask a lot of those quoting\\n1:05:40 questions from the lead code but it's\\n1:05:42 hard to\\n1:05:44 solve them on short time if you have not\\n1:05:47 practiced before\\n1:05:48 it requires practice and lit code\\n1:05:50 probably means like couple of months\\n1:05:52 of practice so it's better to start it\\n1:05:54 in advance then when you are closer to\\n1:05:56 interview you can get a course on\\n1:05:57 grocken\\n1:05:58 system design interview and uh\\n1:06:01 on machine learning design unfortunately\\n1:06:03 on machine learning design there are no\\n1:06:05 good courses yet so whatever i've seen\\n1:06:07 was not quite happy with that\\n1:06:09 so but something is better than nothing\\n1:06:12 plus i had a great experience already at\\n1:06:14 work so\\n1:06:15 it's that was easy for me to tackle\\n1:06:18 and uh do again mock interviews on that\\n1:06:21

your\\n3:29 background can you tell us about your\\n3:31 career journey so far\\n3:32 yeah absolutely so i've had a pretty\\n3:34 interesting background that's all around\\n3:37 data but um in indirect ways so in\\n3:39 school i studied systems engineering\\n3:41 which is sort of a mix of like\\n3:43 operations research business math i was\\n3:46 on the data infrastructure team as an\\n3:48 intern at google i was a growth engineer\\n3:51 and did\\n3:52 data driven experimentation ran and\\n3:54 implemented many a b tests at facebook\\n3:56 and then i joined a location analytics\\n3:59 startup safe graph that sold alternative\\n4:02 data to hedge funds and retail analytics\\n4:04 companies and most recently i wrote the\\n4:06 book ace the data science interview\\n4:07 which is kind of like the cracking the\\n4:09 coding interview or the lead code\\n4:11 for data scientists machine learning\\n4:13 engineers and data analysts so that's\\n4:15 kind of my background around data\\n4:17 and when i read your\\n4:20 bio i think in a book has your biography\\n4:23 and the\", 'video_id': 'tRdLVUKU7Bo'}, {'start': 4500, 'content': \"alized\\n4:14 i didn't really enjoy data science as\\n4:16 much because it was very black box it\\n4:18 fell to me because i never was felt like\\n4:20 i was feeding some model but i didn't\\n4:22 really understand what's going on which\\n4:23 is partially due to the fact that my\\n4:24 mathematics background isn't that strong\\n4:27 so i didn't never really got the theory\\n4:29 behind it\\n4:30 but also i realized i kind of miss more\\n4:32 the engineering parts of it and\\n4:34 that was also the time when data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data scientists but also\\n4:40 people that actually before come before\\n4:42 them and\\n4:43 make data available for data science\\n4:45 because that's at the time was a common\\n4:47 frustration for data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native instruments to be\\n4:58 one of their first data engineers\\n5:01 i did that for a while um i still had\\n5:04 the ambition back then to transition\\n5:05 back into data science but i left native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and i realized eventually that this was\\n5:28 kind of a dead end for me\\n5:30 and so i\\n5:32 i remembered my software engineering\\n5:34 background which i actually enjoyed\\n5:36 except it was a repetitive and then\\n5:38 at the time i was speaking to somebody\\n5:40 at thoughtworks she was the first data\\n5:42 scientist at the thoughtworks in germany\\n5:44 at the time and she told me that\\n5:46 thoughtworks was planning to expand its\\n5:48 data engineering offering and what i'd\\n5:49 be interested in\\n5:52 in becoming the solidworks germany's\\n5:54 first data engineer and help her expand\\n5:56 that offering and i thought it was\\n5:58 really exciting and\\n5:59 especially since southwark is a great\\n6:01 place for really learning good software\\n6:03 engineering practices which as a data\\n6:05 engineer is always frustrated as a data\\n6:07 scientist that always frustrated me that\\n6:09 the quality of the code and the\\n6:11 collaboration wasn't as good as i was i\\n6:13 remembered it from my back in\\n6:14 engineering days\\n6:16 and so i jumped on that and that's when\\n6:17 i finally decided to stay in data\\n6:19 engineering which i had done on and off\\n6:21 before\\n6:23 and then then yeah after that was i went\\n6:26 to where i'm now it was my transfers and\\n6:28 built up data engineering there which\\n6:29 way i'm now heading a team\\n6:32 that's quite a story and thanks for\\n6:33 sharing so uh what i also wanted to ask\\n6:36 you the next question i prepared is that\\n6:38 you were a data scientist and then you\\n6:40 switched to data

there are tools for that and\\n41:27 you can send this data to those tools\\n41:28 so there are these four or five\\n41:30 different tools so\\n41:32 i like to mention this so i like to\\n41:33 think of this data stack\\n41:36 as the modern data stack for growth so\\n41:38 uh typically\\n41:40 if you hear the term modern data stack\\n41:41 uh you generally\\n41:43 hear it in the context of uh analytics\\n41:45 um\\n41:46 modern data stack for analytics is like\\n41:49 how i would\\n41:50 describe it where you have uh you have\\n41:52 an elt tool like five friends stage etc\\n41:55 where ingesting data from all third\\n41:57 party tools into a warehouse\\n41:59 uh and then you have a bi tool and you\\n42:00 have a transformation tool\\n42:02 um so that's typically a modern data\\n42:04 step for analytics\\n42:05 um and dbt is worth mentioning here um\\n42:09 you know it's\\n42:10 growing so fast and you know so many\\n42:11 companies are adopting liberty\\n42:13 for their transformation needs and\\n42:15 modeling needs and then bi tools like\\n42:17 liquid looker mode\\n42:19 etc so so that's like the modern data\\n42:21 stack for analytics\\n42:23 um in terms of modern data stack for\\n42:25 growth i would say\\n42:26 you need a data collection tool a\\n42:28 product analytics tool\\n42:30 um and then a warehouse is is one more\\n42:33 stable states like every company should\\n42:35 have it\\n42:35 um and then of course uh tools that are\\n42:38 that makes\\n42:39 make data available in your downstream\\n42:42 sas tools you know sales marketing\\n42:44 support tools um and that could be a\\n42:46 custom data platform\\n42:48 it could be uh if you're using tools\\n42:50 like segment connections and or radar\\n42:52 stack\\n42:53 they can do that they have that\\n42:54 capability or\\n42:56 if you have if you're storing the data\\n42:58 in the warehouse then you can use a\\n42:59 reverse etl tool\\n43:01 um and each of these categories has\\n43:03 obviously multiple tools so\\n43:05 you know like a lot of them are very\\n43:07 similar\\n43:08 you know some have different\\n43:09 capabilities so it is sort of time\\n43:11

also\\n4:31 worked on analysis and I built Tableau\\n4:34 dashboards and for sure I did a lot of\\n4:38 machine learning mostly for forecasting\\n4:40 and prediction paths\\n4:42 so it was a great time to learn all\\n4:45 those different skills you know I think\\n4:46 that helped me build a good foundation\\n4:49 to the end-to-end data science work and\\n4:52 also it was good for me to understand\\n4:54 what were my strengths\\n4:56 so I enjoyed a lot of this and\\n5:00 um at the time also because I just\\n5:02 didn't plan to move to Berlin\\n5:04 specifically I was dealing with like\\n5:06 this personal change challenges like\\n5:08 learning German and understanding how\\n5:10 life works here in Germany but yeah it\\n5:14 was all about discoveries I would say\\n5:16 the beginning of my career\\n5:18 foreign\\n5:24 title because when I started my career\\n5:27 two like data scientists meant many\\n5:30 different things so I also got to do\\n5:32 analytics data engineering obviously but\\n5:36 now yeah it's more focused I guess right\\n5:39 so maybe in startups data scientists\\n5:41 might still do like all these things but\\n5:43 I think in bigger companies like we have\\n5:45 machine learning Engineers we have data\\n5:47 Engineers we have data scientists who\\n5:49 have data on this and\\n5:51 um\\n5:51 yeah I think it's more focused right now\\n5:53 so it's harder to be a bit harder to be\\n5:56 a generalist right now yes I I agree I\\n6:00 think that at the beginning it was\\n6:02 easier to be a generalist also because\\n6:04 there were not so many tools like we\\n6:06 have now so now with the tools it's\\n6:10 easier to get started in a specific area\\n6:13 like data engineering for example and\\n6:15 then from there really develop your\\n6:17 expertise and be deep into the\\n6:21 areas of engineering instead of going to\\n6:23 deep learning for example would be very\\n6:25 different with different tools\\n6:28 okay so you work the startups and then\\n6:30 you did something else right\\n6:32 yes so I yes I then I started to\\n6:36 understand what I wanted to do and I\\n6:38 wanted really to focus on machine\\n6:39 learning uh also giving my background in\\n6:42 applied math I really enjoyed the\\n6:43 modeling aspect so I moved to work in\\n6:47 like a German company that was more\\n6:50 structured but then I also helped a lot\\n6:53 of the\\n6:54 definition of the roles and also I think\\n6:56 this is one of the things I saw during\\n6:58 my career in the past years like the\\n7:00 evolution of the field also translated\\n7:03 in somehow the evolution of my own\\n7:05 personal career and what I could\\n7:07 contribute to the organizations I was\\n7:09 working for\\n7:10 to come up with those like better\\n7:13 defined roles understand what were the\\n7:15 tools that the field was starting to use\\n7:18 and make it as standard like for example\\n7:21 now we see that there are

journey so far\\n2:28 yeah sure so i have a software\\n2:31 engineering degree\\n2:32 in one of the key universities it's both\\n2:35 bachelor and\\n2:36 master's degree and after that i was\\n2:38 working some time as\\n2:40 a background engineer in java mostly and\\n2:43 just at some point i\\n2:44 learned about data science big data\\n2:46 engineering and\\n2:48 i had some time to make a decision what\\n2:50 exactly i would want to do\\n2:52 and kind of back-end engineering at some\\n2:54 point just got a bit boring for me so\\n2:56 i switched into big data engineering\\n2:59 learned the\\n2:59 scala programming language and that's my\\n3:02 main programming language\\n3:04 now and um for a few years i worked at\\n3:07 a company called sql it's quite famous\\n3:10 in ukraine because it's\\n3:11 quite big company one of the top five\\n3:13 and\\n3:14 it's an outsourcing company which works\\n3:16 with clients and\\n3:18 as well as has some research so i was\\n3:21 working at the\\n3:22 r d department we had some internal\\n3:24 research stuff and\\n3:26 also i worked for some client projects\\n3:28 and\\n3:29 only two years ago i joined captify\\n3:32 which is\\n3:33 a product company they are building a\\n3:35 product in the sphere of\\n3:37 advertising and actually a company is\\n3:40 british it's based in uk\\n3:41 but it has a part of the engineering\\n3:44 team in cave\\n3:44 where i'm based and mostly working on\\n3:48 the product part specifically\\n3:50 in the big data engineering team\\n3:53 yeah i've heard that in advertising\\n3:55 there are there is so much data\\n3:57 that this data engineering big data\\n4:00 engineering becomes really important\\n4:01 because\\n4:02 these companies every day gets get\\n4:04 terabytes of data and they need to\\n4:06 effectively\\n4:07 uh process this data right yeah\\n4:10 and also what kind of makes uh the\\n4:12 solution of creptify unique\\n4:14 is data insights which are obviously\\n4:17 delivered to the help of\\n4:19 big data engineering team by having\\n4:21 different\\n4:22 sources of data and ways to transform\\n4:24 this data and deliver it to the clients\\n4:27 so what do you do at work uh what do you\\n4:29 usually do\\n4:30 as a big data engineer so my main\\n4:33 responsibility is building data\\n4:35 pipelines uh usually it's etl format\\n4:37 extract transform load so kind

that I\\n22:44 just take a Baseline and never change my\\n22:45 model anymore\\n22:47 um because in practice that won't get me\\n22:48 the best results but I do think that\\n22:50 it's in very very often there's more to\\n22:53 get from improvements on the data then\\n22:55 for instance change the entropy in your\\n22:58 decision tree to a tuning for instance\\n23:01 yeah right\\n23:03 um well you said for you the most\\n23:05 important realization was to the mindset\\n23:08 shift from not just how we do this but\\n23:11 also that you know data set is not a\\n23:14 static thing you can change it but I'm\\n23:16 still wondering how do we actually do\\n23:18 this like for what are the tools what\\n23:21 are the approaches uh for that how do we\\n23:23 implement this yeah that's a very good\\n23:26 question\\n23:27 um so there's not one toolbox that I can\\n23:30 recommend that has everything I think\\n23:31 it's a very broad subject it's it's also\\n23:33 what you like to focus on there's a lot\\n23:35 of tools out there that can help you\\n23:37 with labeling\\n23:39 um or finding the delay the the data\\n23:42 points in your data that need to be\\n23:43 labeled but of course there's different\\n23:45 tools for text based or image based or\\n23:47 audio based but there's way more to data\\n23:50 Centric AI than just relabeling there\\n23:52 are also tools for\\n23:54 um for instance generating synthetic\\n23:56 data time how do you create good\\n23:58 synthetic data to augment your your\\n24:00 current data set so there's a very broad\\n24:03 spectrum of things that are all data\\n24:05 related and there's also a lot of\\n24:08 development at the moment being done on\\n24:10 these tools because I think that at the\\n24:12 moment we all experience especially\\n24:14 working with Foundation models working\\n24:17 with unstructured data we experience a\\n24:19 need for tools that help us out with\\n24:21 these kinds of things so a lot is\\n24:23 currently being developed\\n24:25 um a lot of high-tech tools a lot of\\n24:28 low-tech tools as well I'm a personally\\n24:30 a big fan of not using one thing and\\n24:34 having everything work out of the box I\\n24:36 wouldn't like the magic fix all your bad\\n24:39 labels tool that there would if there\\n24:42 would be one because I think that I have\\n24:45 my value as a data scientist is in\\n24:47 understanding the data and talking with\\n24:49 subject matter experts so I I'd like to\\n24:51 have a lot of control over that process\\n24:55 um and I think the most important lesson\\n24:57 that we learned is that it at the end\\n24:59 it's not about what tools you use it's\\n25:02 about how easy you make it for yourself\\n25:03 to\\n25:05 um to iterate on the data and how you\\n25:08 keep track of that so that could mean\\n25:09 that you use DVC to version your data\\n25:12 and you have a go\", 'video_id': 't3HDdVWQzNM'}, {'start': 43500, 'content': \" that\\n38:06 you

like\\n38:26 to implement all of these different\\n38:27 tools you'd\\n38:28 uh need like a lot of resources you'd\\n38:30 need a data team\\n38:32 um at least a couple of or maybe at\\n38:34 least one dedicated data engineer\\n38:36 so it's not possible for early stage\\n38:38 startups to do everything\\n38:40 um and that's where it's also worth\\n38:43 mentioning\\n38:44 cdp's customer data platforms which are\\n38:47 sort of they're like an all-in-one\\n38:49 bundled solution\\n38:50 where you can track data and then you\\n38:52 can send data to different tools\\n38:54 um so you can like you can create\\n38:56 audiences and create your\\n38:57 models and segments inside a cdp of\\n39:00 course\\n39:01 it has limited capabilities you can't\\n39:03 exactly do everything you can do in a\\n39:04 warehouse\\n39:05 but it still gives a lot of flexibility\\n39:07 to marketers and growth\\n39:09 professionals to to you know work with\\n39:11 data without relying on\\n39:13 on data teams so yeah\\n39:16 i was trying to take a note of all the\\n39:20 tools you mentioned but there are simply\\n39:21 so many\\n39:23 and i'm wondering so let's say i just\\n39:25 started the startup\\n39:27 i and my co-founder so i haven't started\\n39:30 the startup i'm just like a hypothetical\\n39:31 hypothetical yeah\\n39:32 yes so i have a co-founder so there are\\n39:35 two of us we just started the startup\\n39:37 and to understand that data is important\\n39:40 we want to collect and we look at all\\n39:42 these tools and\\n39:43 there are just too many like how do we\\n39:45 make a decision which tool to choose\\n39:47 like\\n39:48 uh i think it's not about are they\\n39:51 different\\n39:51 similar yeah how to choose yeah i think\\n39:54 i think it's first important to define\\n39:56 what your\\n39:56 goals are uh and a good way to think\\n39:59 about this is to like just\\n40:00 list down uh you know 10 questions that\\n40:02 you want to answer with data\\n40:04 and then work backwards and and figure\\n40:06 out the tools uh\\n40:08 of course there are ready-made tools but\\n40:09 a lot of companies end up\\n40:11 uh you know fixing these problems or\\n40:14

can also get expensive but\\n40:24 uh at the very least you need\\n40:26 you need to start collecting data so you\\n40:29 need uh tool\\n40:30 like a cdi to like segment connections\\n40:32 broader

was feeding some model but i didn't\\n4:22 really understand what's going on which\\n4:23 is partially due to the fact that my\\n4:24 mathematics background isn't that strong\\n4:27 so i didn't never really got the theory\\n4:29 behind it\\n4:30 but also i realized i kind of miss more\\n4:32 the engineering parts of it and\\n4:34 that was also the time when data\\n4:36 engineering became more of a thing\\n4:37 because companies realized that they\\n4:38 need not just data scientists but also\\n4:40 people that actually before come before\\n4:42 them and\\n4:43 make data available for data science\\n4:45 because that's at the time was a common\\n4:47 frustration for data scientists to not\\n4:48 have data\\n4:51 great ambitions but no data\\n4:54 and then i went\\n4:56 got an offer at native instruments to be\\n4:58 one of their first data engineers\\n5:01 i did that for a while um i still had\\n5:04 the ambition back then to transition\\n5:05 back into data science but i left native\\n5:07 instruments for unrelated reasons before\\n5:10 that happened\\n5:12 then i got another job at another\\n5:13 company as a bi developer\\n5:18 my title was data scientists but really\\n5:19 what i did was\\n5:21 develop custom\\n5:23 with data visualizations\\n5:26 and i realized eventually that this was\\n5:28 kind of a dead end for me\\n5:30 and so i\\n5:32 i remembered my software engineering\\n5:34 background which i actually enjoyed\\n5:36 except it was a repetitive and then\\n5:38 at the time i was speaking to somebody\\n5:40 at thoughtworks she was the first data\\n5:42 scientist at the thoughtworks in germany\\n5:44 at the time and she told me that\\n5:46 thoughtworks was planning to expand its\\n5:48 data engineering offering and what i'd\\n5:49 be interested in\\n5:52 in becoming the solidworks germany's\\n5:54 first data engineer and help her expand\\n5:56 that offering and i thought it was\\n5:58 really exciting and\\n5:59 especially since southwark is a great\\n6:01 place for really learning good software\\n6:03 engineering practices which as a data\\n6:05 engineer is always frustrated as a data\\n6:07 scientist that always frustrated me that\\n6:09 the quality of the code and the\\n6:11 collaboration wasn't as good as i was i\\n6:13 remembered it from my back in\\n6:14 engineering days\\n6:16 and so i jumped on that and that's when\\n6:17 i finally decided to stay in data\\n6:19 engineering which i had done on and off\\n6:21 before\\n6:23 and then then yeah after that was i went\\n6:26 to where i'm now it was my transfers

question is\\n50:30 what's the hardest thing you have\\n50:33 you need to deal with as a manager\\n50:38 i think\\n50:42 i'm thinking okay i think there was more\\n50:44 than one but maybe i can\\n50:47 you can give yes i can tell you yes i\\n50:49 can tell you\\n50:54 losing losing someone in the team that\\n50:57 uh\\n50:58 you know that was\\n51:00 very close to the team i was you know\\n51:02 like that like it's like sometimes there\\n51:04 are people that that come to\\n51:06 the team or maybe they'll completely you\\n51:08 know involve or not but when you\\n51:11 sometimes when sponsoring somebody\\n51:14 is they are very good they bring that\\n51:17 spirit they they\\n51:19 they work you know\\n51:22 to make they not just themselves but\\n51:25 everybody around them have a better time\\n51:27 uh\\n51:28 seeing them live is super painful like\\n51:31 now you never get used to that\\n51:34 okay how do you deal with this just\\n51:36 accept that people move on right\\n51:38 is there any other way\\n51:43 you\\n51:44 first is why because you the same as\\n51:47 when you give feedback like you you wish\\n51:49 them the best okay you you\\n51:52 you think they are\\n51:53 let's say\\n51:54 if they choose that is because they\\n51:56 think it's the best for them so you\\n51:58 support right like i think\\n52:04 supporting that person on their live\\n52:07 choices like this\\n52:09 is what a manager should do right yeah\\n52:12 sorry i got emotional\\n52:14 like who would ask that question\\n52:22 that's one of the hardest ones for me\\n52:27 yeah i

will help them okay\\n47:39 um\\n47:40 [Music]\\n47:42 maybe too generic we can maybe do an\\n47:44 exercise and give it with a concrete\\n47:45 sample i know if it's the objective of\\n47:47 today but\\n47:48 uh\\n47:50 yeah but basically like it boils down to\\n47:52 caring about the person and then uh\\n47:55 when you're not\\n47:56 close uh\\n47:58 like maybe in the first month you ask\\n47:59 first\\n48:00 and then\\n48:02 i guess the rest is uh just happens\\n48:04 naturally right\\n48:06 okay yeah having feedback often also\\n48:08 helps like\\n48:10 having regular one once right\\n48:13 yes yes like uh one-on-ones like for me\\n48:15 as a manager that should happen at least\\n48:18 once a week\\n48:19 except that of course like\\n48:22 with a very senior person maybe 30\\n48:24 minutes or 15 minutes catch up\\n48:26 uh once a week that's fine but\\n48:30 don't don't feel comp like you you will\\n48:33 feel compelled like if there is no\\n48:34 topics to skip it but there is always\\n48:37 something to talk even at least to say\\n48:39 like you know even more with remote\\n48:40 setup right even at least you say hi and\\n48:43 see how the person is

bigger right\\n48:59 i\\n49:00 i always have this i don't know\\n49:02 philosophy they say the same one as i\\n49:04 told you that i treat people you know\\n49:06 better like the same or better the
